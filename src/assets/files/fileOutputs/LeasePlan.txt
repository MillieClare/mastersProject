(“LeasePlan”, “the Company”, or “the Issuer”) is a Car - as - a - Service (“Caas”) provider and the operator of a digital marketplace for high - quality used vehicles. LeasePlan has operations in over 30 countries and 1.8 million vehicles currently under managemen t, serving individuals , governments, and companies of all sizes. LeasePlan has developed the LeasePlan Green Bond Framework (the “ F ramework ”) under which it is planning to issue green bonds (“Green Bonds”) and use the proceeds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part , investments in clean transportation projects, namely the purchase of electric vehicles. LeasePlan engaged Sustainalytics to review the Framework and provide a second - party opinion on (i) the alignment of the Framework with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (the “GBP”), as administered by the International Capital Market Association (the “ICMA”) , 1 and (ii) the F ramework’s environmental credentials. Th e F ramework has been published in a separate document . 2 As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of LeasePlan ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporti ng aspects con sider ed for the Company ’s G reen B ond . Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information . This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with th e F ramework. 1 ICMA’s Green Bond Principles 2018 https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ 2 Framework available at: https://www.leaseplan.com/corporate/investors/debtholder - centre,Second - Party Opinion LeasePlan Green Bond 3 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the LeasePlan Green Bond Framework Summary Sust ainalytics is of the opinion that the Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four cor e components of the GBP . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of the F ramework :  Use of Proceeds: - The eligibility criteria, financing the acquisition of battery - powered electric vehicles , is recognized by the Green Bond Principles as a project category with positive env ironmental benefits, which will contribute towards the global transition to a low carbon economy. - Sustainalytics views favourably the fact that LeasePlan aims to promote clean transportation by investing the G reen B ond proceeds exclusively in electric vehicles, which provide the greatest GHG emissions reductions of all vehicle technologies . (Please refer to Section 3 for an in - depth assessment of the use of proceeds’ environmental impact). To further clarify the definition of an eligible veh icle, the Framework specifically excludes vehicles that are powered through fossil fuel combustion, ethanol and biofuels , as well as plug - in hybrids. - LeasePlan applies a 24 - month look - back period to refinanc ing, which Sustainalytics considers to be aligned with market practice. Additionally, the Framework states an intention to allocate approximately half of the proceeds to future expenditures, on a best effort basis.  Project Selection Process: - LeasePlan defines eligible projects as its investments which increase the proportion of electric vehicles within its fleet. A Sustainability Steering Committee (“Committee”) is responsible for ensu ring that allocations are aligned with the F ramework. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, and consists of representatives from Commerce, Procurement, Human Relations, Investor Relations, and LeasePlan Nederland N.V. , and will meet at least quarterly . - Based on the review of allocations by the Committee, Sust ainalytics considers this process to be aligned with market practice.  Management of Proceeds: - LeasePlan Treasur y , which is the centrali s ed funding centre for LeasePlan and its subsidiaries , will manage the proceeds of the Green B ond using a portfolio appro ach . The funds will be tracked though internal reporting systems, with a dedicated member of each of the International Funding team and the CSR department charged with validating allocations . Unallocated proceeds will be held in cash or short - term investme nts, in accordance with LeasePlan T reasury policies. - Oversight of the allocations will be provided by t he Committee on a quarterly basis . - Based on the disclosure of the portfolio approach and temporary investments , tracking through internal reporting systems , as well as the dedicated oversight responsibility, Sustainalytics considers the management of proceeds to be in line with market practice.  Reporting: - LeasePlan commits to providing annual updates on the allocation of proceeds , including both the a mount and percentage allocated, as well as the unallocated balance . LeasePlan will also , subject to data availability, report on impact metrics such as its weighted average fleet carbon intensity and e stimated CO 2 emissions avoided . - Based on the commitment to both allocation and impact reporting, t his is considered to be in line with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that the Framework aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 201 8 . For detailed information p lease refer to Appendix 1 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form.,Second - Party Opinion LeasePlan Green Bond 4 Section 2: Sustainability Performance of the Issuer Contribution of F ramework to the I ssuer’s sustainability strategy Lease Plan’s sustainability strategy is underpinned by a commitment to social and environmental responsibility, within both its business operations as well as its corporate culture. To implement this approach, the Company has identified three key focus areas, each with associated act ion items: 3  Low emission mobility: LeasePlan is committed to “ taking a leadership role in the transition from internal combustion engines to alternative powertrains . ” A target of net - zero fleet emissions by 2030 has been established, including both the roll - out of low emissions vehicles, deployment of charging infrastructure, and the use of high - impact carbon offsetting. Additionally, the Company intends to have 100% electric vehicles in its employee fleet by 2021 and has engaged with organisations such as the World Economic Forum and The Climate Group’s EV100 initiative to promote policies in support of this transition.  Contribute to strengthening societal wellbeing: The Company is undertaking a variety of programs, both within and external to the organisation , intended to promote positive social outcomes. This includes road - safety training for customers and employees, updating its Supplier Code of Conduct, 4 and the i ntroduction of an Occupational Health & Safety policy.  Reduce overall environmental impact: LeasePlan commits to “leading by example” to reduce the impact of its own operations, through building - level energy efficiency initiatives, the procurement of rene wable energy, waste and water use reduction programs, and implementation of Task Force on Climate - Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. LeasePlan has reported on its sustainability progress in its report Road to zero emission mobility . 5 T he 2017 accomplishments include launching an electric vehicle pilot program for corporate clients and the release of the first annual Sustainable Fleet Benchmark , showing year - over - year progress in the expansion of alternative powertrain vehicles and decre ase in average vehicle engine size and total fleet carbon emissions . 6 Sustainalytics views positively the principles and commitments of LeasePlan’s sustainability strategy . Of particular note are the use of time - bound targets and participation in multi - stakeholder initiatives under the auspices of international organisations . Lease P lan also has an ongoing commitment to improving its CSR reporting metrics, which are expected to include indicators s uch as the share of electric vehicles, CO 2 emissions per kilometer and tonnes of CO 2 emitted per year . Overall, Sustainalytics considers the objectives of the Framework to be aligned with the Company’s overall sustainability strategy, especially the pillar of low emission mobility . As such , we believe LeasePlan is well - positioned to issue green bonds. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While the use of proceeds of LeasePlan’s green bonds are antic ipated to deliver overall environmental benefits, as with any large investment there may be environmental and social risks associated with the projects undertaken. For the deployment of electric vehicles, the most relevant risks include the environmental a nd social impacts of electric vehicle supply chains, including batteries , and health & safety risks related to vehicle operations. LeasePlan’s Code of Conduct takes steps to mitigate these risks, starting with a Code of Conduct which lays out the princip les of honesty and trust, respect for the law, human rights, and sustainability. 7 To specifically address the risks in its supply chain, which for a company in the automotive sector are among the most material risks faced, LeasePlan has implemented several measures. These include a Supplier Code of Conduct, which lays out the expectation that the companies with which LeasePlan works respect local and international and human rights standards, as well as specifically listing actions suppliers must take such a s not us ing forced or compulsory labour , not employ ing child labour , and recognis ing that environmental responsibility is important and support a precautionary approach to environmental protection . 8 As a complement to this policy, the Company has issued a Modern Slavery Statement, reaffirming a commitment 3 LeasePlan Corporate Website Sustainability; accessed February 2019; http s://www.leaseplan.com/corporate/sustainability 4 LeasePlan Corporate Website Supplier Code of Conduct; accessed February 2019; https://www.leaseplan.com/corporate/site - services/supplier - code - of - conduct 5 LeasePlan Corporate Website Accelerating the zero em issions revolution; accessed February 2019; https://www.leaseplan.com/corporate/sustainability/accelerating - the - zero - emission - mobility - revolution - sc 6 This document has been provided to Sustainalytics for review. 7 LeasePlan Corporate Website Code of Condu ct; accessed February 2019; https://www.leaseplan.com/corporate/site - services/code - of - conduct 8 LeasePlan Corporate Website Supplier Code of Conduct; accessed February 2019; https://www.leaseplan.com/corporate/site - services/supplier - code - of - conduct,Second - Party Opinion LeasePlan Green Bond 5 “ to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain .” 9 LeasePlan also endorses the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the principles of the Interna tional Labour Organisation . 10 Sustainalytics recognizes that some risks related to the use of cars cannot be mitigated by LeasePlan, and are instead dependent on customers and other third partie s; t hese include road safety and vehicle end of life management. Nevertheless, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that LeasePlan is well - positioned to address the common environmental and social risks associated with the projects funded by any Green Bonds linked to this Framework . Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds The use of proceeds categor y – clean transportation – is recogni s ed as impactful by the GBP . Sustainalytics has focused below on how the impact is specifically relevant in LeasePlan’s operational context. The r elevance of c lean t ransportation on a g lobal s cale I n 2014 , the transportation sector as a whole was responsible for around 23% of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion globally . 11 Passenger and commercial cars are particular ly important for LeasePlan, as their business model involves fleet management services worldwide. Even though electric vehicles make up a constantly growing share of total vehicles (over 1 million vehicles in 2015 and 2 million in 2016), fossil fuel - powered c ars still dominate the landscape, with over 900 million internal combustion engine passenger vehicles on the road today . 12 According to a report by the International Transport Forum (ITF), a specialized intergovernmental organization within the OECD, the vo lumes of the transportation sector will experience substantial growth across all its segments, including passenger and commercial cars, by 2050, resulting in potential CO 2 emissions increases of 60% by 2050 in the absence of proper mitigation measures. 13 Mo reover, the report also highlights that while the Nationally Determined Contribution of member states pledged to the Paris Climate Agreement provide CO 2 reduction ambitions, the measures proposed are not sufficiently clear in assess ing the environmental im pact of the transportation sector, and will likely miss their targets if growing emissions from passenger and freight mobility are not addressed . 14 Given the context, Sustainalytics views favourably LeasePlan’s investments in acquiring low - emissions vehicles , which will result in reduce d GHG emissions and, in turn, support the achievement of Paris Climate Agreement targets in countries around the world . The importance of electric vehicles for low - emissions mobility Given the necessity of decarbonis ing road transportation to meet global climate targets, various technologies have been proposed to replace conventional internal combustion engines. These include vehicles powered by alternative fossil fuels or biofuels, hybrid gas - electric vehicles, and h ydrogen fuel cell vehicles, in addition to battery - powered electric vehicles. 15 While many of these options may provide some environmental benefit when compared to gasoline or diesel powertrains, they are not equivalent in terms of overall emissions, at eit her the tailpipe or on a lifecycle “wells - to - wheels” basis. While electric vehicles produce emissions related to both battery manufacturing as well as the generation of electricity , these lifecycle emissions are generally much lower than for hybrid cars, even in regions with carbon intensive grids. 16 Furthermore, some models demonstrate that by coordinating battery charging, the amount 9 Lease Plan Corporate Website Modern Slavery Statement; accessed February 2019; https://www.leaseplan.com/corporate/site - services/modern - slavery - statement 10 LeasePlan Corporate Website Sustainability; accessed February 2019; https://www.leaseplan.com/corporate/su stainability 11 Road Transport and CO2 emissions: What are the challenges?; Georgina Santos; published October 2017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S09670 70X17304262 12 Number of passenger cars and commercial vehicles in use worldwide from 2006 to 2015 in (1,000 units); https://www.statista.com/statistics/281134/n umber - of - vehicles - in - use - worldwide/ ; International Energy Agency, Global EV Outlook 2017; https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/GlobalEVOutlook2017.pdf 13 ITF Transport Outlook 2017; published January 2017; https://www.itf - oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/transport - co2 - paris - climate - agreement - ndcs.pdf 14 ITF Transport Outlook 2017; published January 2017; https://www.itf - oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/transport - co2 - paris - climate - agreement - ndcs.pdf 15 Emissions from Hybrid and Plug - In Electric Vehicles, Alternative Fuels Data Center, https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.html 16 How mu ch CO2 do electric vehicles, hybrids and gasoline vehicles emit?, ; NEB ; accessed February 2019; https://www.neb - one.gc.ca/nrg/ntgrtd/mrkt/ftrrtcl/2018 - 09 - 12hwmchcrbndxd - eng.html,Second - Party Opinion LeasePlan Green Bond 6 of new generation capacity required will be limited, even at very high penetration rates. 17 Regarding hydrogen, while it is a clean - burning fuel, the vast majority of current supply is produced from the steam reformation of natural gas, with resulting carbon emissions. 18 While some biofuels have low lifecycle carbon emissions, land use change as well as competition with food sto cks may pose additional environmental and social risks. 19 Considering these factors, Sustainalytics views positively LeasePlan’s focus on battery electric vehicles. Alignment with and contribution to the S ustainable D evelopment G oals The Sustainable Deve lopment Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. This G reen B ond advances the following 20 SDG goals and targets: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Clean Transportation 11 . Sustainable Cities and Communities 11 .2 By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnera ble situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons Conclusion LeasePlan has developed the LeasePlan Green Bond Framework, under which it intends to issue Green Bonds , and use the proceeds to fund investments in clean transport ation, specifically the purchase of electric vehicles for its fleet. The use of proceeds category specified in the Framework is aligned with those of the Green Bond Principles 2018; LeasePlan has described a process by which proceeds will be tracked, all ocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the investments funded by the Green Bonds will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustaina ble Development Goals, in particular Goal 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that LeasePlan is well - positioned to issue Green Bonds , and that the LeasePlan Green Bond Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018. 17 Energy use, cost and CO2 emissions of electric cars, Vliet et al ; accessed Fe bruary 2019; https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229376531_Energy_use_cost_and_CO2_emissions_of_electric_cars 18 The Development of Lifecycle Data for Hydrogen Fuel Production and Delivery ; CARB ; accessed February 2019; https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/ apr/past/14 - 318.pdf 19 Do Biofuels Reduce Greenhouse Gases?, Kevin Bullis, https://www.technologyreview.com/s/424050/do - biofuels - reduce - greenhouse - gases/ 20 Sustainalytics has stated the SDG which it has assessed to be most relevant to the use of proceeds category.
