Headquartered in San Jose, California, Bloom is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and employs over 1,500 employees. Bloom has develop ed the Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework (the “ F r amework ”) under which it intends to issue a green bond and use the proceeds to finance and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and/ or future projects that will reduce the carbon footprint of the Company’s operations , in addition to providing other environmental and resiliency benefits . The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in seven areas: 1. Renewable Energy 2. Energy Efficiency 3. Climate Change Adaptation 4. Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management 5. Pollution Prevention and Control 6. Green Buildings 7. Clean and Mass Transportation Bloom engaged Sustainalytics to review the Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework , dated September 2020 , and provide a S econd - P arty O pinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) . 1 This F ramework has been published in a separate document which can be found on Bloom’s investor relations website www.investor.bloomenergy.com . 2 Scope of work and lim itations of Sustainalytics Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent 3 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • T he Framework’s al ignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA ; • The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; • The alignment of the issuer ’ s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relat ion to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.5 , which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustain alytics held conversations with various members of Bloom ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Bloom repr esentatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of Bloom to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and (3) that any pro vided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. Any update of the present Second - Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and Bloom . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ . 2 The Blo om Energy Green Bond Framework is available on Bloom Energy Corporation ’s website at: www.investor.bloomenergy.com 3 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustai nalytics and e nsuring analyst independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust con flict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consistency of process, s tructural separation of commercial and research (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity , another is transparency.,Second - Party Opinion Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework 3 standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed wi th bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the i ntended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or argument either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statem ents and related surrounding circumstances that Bloom has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second - Party Opinion . Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the GBP . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Bloom ’ s G reen B ond F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible categor ies: Renewable Energy , Energy Efficiency , Climate Change Adaptation , Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management , Pollution Prevention and Control , Green Buildings , and Clean and Mass Transportation , are aligned with those recognized by the GBP. - Within the Renewable Energy category, the Company intends on financing the following: ▪ Research and development (R&D) of biogas, hydroge n , and B ioenergy with C arbon C apture and Storage (BECCS) applications. • Sustainalytics views positively these R&D activities as (i) they are anticipated to have positive environmental outcomes , (ii) the Framework defines specific product types and application areas for R&D expenditure s, and (iii) Bloom has a demonstrated track record of developing and deploying new and advanced technology. It is noted that it is more difficult to track and measure impacts until products reach the commercialization stage , and Sustainalytics therefore encourages Bloom to disclose the anticipated/ targeted outcomes of such R&D initiatives through percentage savings or a qualitative description of expected outcomes . • Sustainalytics considers CCS to be an environmentally impactful activity in line with green bond market expectations when applied to bi oenergy (BECCS). ▪ Manufacturing of technology used for cleaning of biogas . Such cleanup modules are required to transform biogas into a substitute for pipeline - quality natural gas and will be installed with the intent of increasing the supply of renewable natural gas (RNG) to power Bloom’s cells. Sustainalytics considers these installations to provide environmental benefits (see comment below as it relates to the use of landfill ga s). ▪ Manufacturing of electrolyzers to produce hydrogen from electrolysis of water . Sustainalytics notes that while electrolysis can make use of electricity from both renewable and fossil fuel sources, that improved and expanded capacity to produce hydrogen from electricity enables an overall greening of hydrogen production . ▪ Manufacturing of Bloom Energy S er vers , Bloom’s solid oxide fuel cell platform , that are intended to run on clean fuels such as biogas or hydrogen. C urrently, Bloom’s servers rely primarily on natural gas input s ; cells destined for this use will not be financed by green bond proceeds . Sustainalytics views the production of fuel cells which run on low - carbon fuels to be aligned with market practice. ▪ Developing biogas projects to ge nerate renewable fuels from waste , such as from agricultural waste, municipal landfills, or wastewater treatment facilities . Bloom intends to carry out these projects to provide low - carbon fuels for its fuel cells.,Second - Party Opinion Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework 4 • Feedstock utilized in such projects will meet the emissions criteria prescribed by Climate Bonds Initiative and sourcing criteria prescribed by California Air Resources Board. Sustainalytics views positively this incorporation of external criteria in the project selection process. • Landfill Gas ( LFG) capture for energy generation reduce s methane emissions relative to landfills with no gas capture , and provides an option for low carbon energy prod uction . Nevertheless, Sustainalytics does not always consider investments in LFG capture facilities to provide the level of net impact suitable for a green bond, noting that investments in landfilling facilities may promote unsustainable waste management practices . Bloom intends on financing LFG capture projects on the closed or decommissioned cells of land fills where currently surplus methane generated is flared . Sustainalytics therefore views favourably the intent of the projects financed under this category and their potential environmental benefits , an d encourages ongoing monitoring of fugitive methane and compliance with the waste hierarchy. - Within the Energy Efficiency category, Bloom intends on financing equipment maintenance and upgrades, namely its fuel cell stack replacement program . Eligible systems will be those that are current ly operating on biogas or hydrogen or that, through the upgrades carried out, are being enabled to transition to full hydrogen compatibility. Fuel cell performance tends to deteriorate over time and replacement can lead to overall improved energy efficienc y thereby delivering positive environmental outcomes. Further, switching to cleaner fuels such as hydrogen from natural gas will also lead to environmental benefits. Accordingly, Sustainalytics considers investments planned under this category to be aligne d with market practice. - Within the Climate Change Adaptation category, Bloom intends on financing expenses related to components specific to microgrids that could be installed at client sites (mainly commercial & industrial customers) to supply on - demand e lectricity and manage grid instability caused by climate - triggered events . Sustainalytics notes that majority of these investments are planned in the state of California where grid stability and climate - driven disasters are a major problem (please refer Section 3 for more details) and therefore considers investments in such technologies to b e aligned with market practice , while noting that best practice for the financing of climate adaptation is to conduct robust vulnerabili ty assessments . - Within the Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management category, Bloom intends on financing projects aimed at improving water efficiency in Bloom’s electrolyzer and fuel cell systems that use water during start - up. Sustainalytics considers investments in this category to be aligned with market practice and encourages reporting on the quantitative benefits achieved . - Within the Pollution Prevention and Control category, Bloom intends on financing projects that enable end - of - life recycling of components of its Energy Server systems. Sustainalytics views positively that such programs can enable recycling of up to 98% of Energy Server components and considers investments planned in this category to be aligned with market practice. - Within the Green Buildings category, Bloom intends on financing the construction or upgrades of its office space with an intention to reduce the carbon footprint of its corporate buildings. Such buildings/ upgrades will be certified by third - party certific ation schemes such as LEED, BREEAM or Energy Star. Sustainalytics considers the schemes cited to be credible , the levels (LEED Gold or Higher, BREEAM Very Good or Higher) to be robust , and accordingly these investments to be aligned with market practice . P lease refer to Appendix 1 on details about the certification schemes. - Within the Clean and Mass Transportation category, Bloom intends on financing expenditures related to manufacturing of Energy Servers with Electric Vehicle (EV) charging capability, EV c harging components, or electrolyzers to generate renewable hydrogen for fuel in transport. Sustainalytics considers investments in EVs and associated infrastructure to be positive for the environment and aligned with market practice. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - Projects will be evaluated by Bloom’s Sustainability , Quality, Operations, Engineering and Product teams working cross - functionally t o ensure alignment with the criteria specified above as well as overall objectives of the Compa ny. - Final approval of the projects will be jointly provided by the Treasurer and Head of Environmental and Social Governance of Bloom.,Second - Party Opinion Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework 5 - Based o n the well - defined process for project evaluation and executive - level participation in approvals , Sustainalytics conside rs this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - Bloom Energy has established an internal tracking system to manage proceeds from issuance led by Finance and Treasury . - Bloom Energy intends on utilizing bond proceeds to finance expenses incurred within two years preceding the date of issuance or new projects up to and including bond maturity . Pending allocation of proceeds, Bloom intends on investing the funds in liquid a ssets such as cash, equivalents or other securities in line with Bloom Energy’s investment policy. Sustainalytics considers market practice to be allocating the net proceeds within 24 months of issuance and notes that Bloom may exceed this timeline. - Based on a well - defined policy for managing proceeds and disclosure on temporary allocation , Sustainalytics considers this process overall to be in line with market practice . • Reporting: - Bloom Energy intends on preparing and making publicly available on its website an annual report outlining allocations from bond proceeds on a project - portfolio basis along with the outstanding amount of proceeds yet to be allocated. - The report will also include performance on key impact measurement parameters such as CO 2 e emissions avoided, criteria pollutant emissions avoided, and water savings and , where feasible, a selection of brief project descriptions. - Based on the commitment to both allocation and impact reporting , Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that the Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 2 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of Bloom Contribution of framework to Bloom Energy Corporation ’s sustainabili ty strategy Bloom’s current business involves developing and operating solid oxide fuel cell platforms installed on client sites to provide continuous, reliable, and on - demand energy without combustion. These systems serve as backup source s of power especially in areas with grid stability issues providing a more energy efficient alternative to the grid . Accordingly, each Bloom system leads to implied carbon reduction and in 2019, the Company reported a 28% reduction in CO 2 e versus the grid f or the energy generated from its systems . 4 Bloom’s energy systems have an emissions rate of 679 - 833 lbs. CO 2 /MWh which is significantly lower than that reported by coal plants (2,065 lbs. CO 2 /MWh) and natural gas plants (895 - 1 , 037 lbs. CO 2 /MWh) . Sustainab ility is a core part of Bloom’s business and it is committed to rapid decarbonization through its product and business strategy . The Company primarily relies on natural gas as fuel for its Energy Server systems and is focused on scaling its procurement from decomposing waste in landfills through investments planned under this Framework. 5 Sustainalytics views positively the intention to transition to biogas which is a cleaner fuel as compared to natural gas . Further, Bloom continues to finance R&D to evolve its hydrogen offering which will enable the Company to transition its fuel cell systems to hydrogen compatibility and further reduce lifecycle emissions . In lin e with this larger objective, Bloom has recently announced the following key partnerships : - In July 2020, Bloom announced its entry int o commercial hydrogen through a partnership to sell hydrogen - powered fuel cells and electrolyzers to produce renewable hydrogen to a large conglomerate in South Korea . The transaction will generate over $1 billion in revenues for Bloom 4 Bloom Energy SEC filings, Schedule 14A: 2020 Notice and Proxy Statement at: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edga r/data/1664703/000114036120007743/nc10010494x1_def14a.htm#a_007 5 Bloom Energy SEC filings, Form 10 - K, Annual Report at: http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.clou dfront.net/CIK - 0001664703/2cb2719d - 14a5 - 4af1 - 86d3 - 45fab852d821.pdf,Second - Party Opinion Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework 6 over its lifetime and is aligned with the South Korean governmen t’s objective of building 1,200 stations to fuel a planned 6.2 million hydrogen cars by 2040. 6 - In October 2019, Bloom announced a partnership with a California - based dairy technology company to develop and commercially deploy the world’s first end - to - end solution for the capture of methane from dairy waste and its conversion to renewable electricity. 7 - In June 2020, Bloom announced a partnership with Samsung Heavy Industries to design and deve lop fuel - cell powered ships that could serve as an efficient and less - pollutive alternative in the shipping industry. 8 Through these partnerships and research initiatives, Bloom continues to transition to a business model with cleaner sources of fuel via its product offering . Accordingly, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework is aligned with the company’s overall sustainability strategy and initiatives and will further the Company’s action on its key environmental prio rities. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics anticipates that Bloom’s intended investments under the Framework will lead to positive environmental outcomes, it does recognize en vironmental and social risks that could be associated with these investments . Some of the key risks include environment, health and safety risks associated with construction , operation, and maintenance of hydrogen generation and distribution infrastructure as well as materials handling and manufacturing . Sustai nalytics acknowledges that Bloom address es some of the risks mentioned above through existing Environmental Health & Safety (EH &S) policies, procedures and programs and is currently in the process of developing an Environmental Management System (EMS) , the first phase of which is intended to be completed by end of the current year. In addition to reviewing existing policies and re sources , Sustainalytics encourage s the issuer t o pri oritize development of the EMS and make any relevant subsequently developed policies publicly available when launched. Sustainalytics notes other mechanisms in place that mitigate the above risks as foll ows : • All projects that are taken up by Bloom are subject to oversight and governance from local , state, and national regulations regarding the environment and health & safety . Bloom has a Code of Conduct in place which delineates responsibility of compliance on the employees and contractors . • Bloom has training and retraining programs to ensure employee compliance with existing health and safety policies and has designed specific policies for activities with higher safety risk such as construction, operation of heavy equipment, and for protection from falls. • The Bloom Energy Safety Team (BEST) is a joint cross - functional worker and management committee instated to promote a safe and injury - free workplace which meets at least quarter ly to discuss EH&S updates and champion safety communication throughout the organization. • Sustainalytics notes that Bloom ’s headquarters and primary market is the United States, which is recognized under the Equator Principle’s Designated Countries 9 list for having robust environmental and social governance, as well as strong legislation in place. • All of Bloom’s systems are built to comply with leading design and safety standards such as ANSI, IEEE, ASME, and NFPA. • Bloom relies on prudent electrical practices for installation of equipment which includes practices, equipment, specifications and standards relied upon by players in the grid - tied fuel cell electrical generation market in the US or those that are specific ally approved by North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). Based on these policies, procedures and program standards and assessments and subject to timely implementation of the EMS under development , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Bloo m has implemented 6 Businesswire report, Bloom Energy announces initial strategy for hydrogen market entry, published on July 15 2020 at: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200715005286/en/ 7 Bloom Energy website, Calbio and Bloom Energy to generate renewable electricity from dairy waste, published on October 10, 2019 at: https://www .bloomenergy.com/newsroom/press - releases/calbio - and - bloom - energy - generate - renewable - electricity - dairy - waste 8 Bloom Energy website, Samsung Heavy Industries and Bloom Energy advance plans for clean power ships with joint development ag reement published on June 29, 2020 at: https://www.bloomenergy.com/newsroom/press - releases/samsung - heavy - industries - and - bloom - energy - ad vance - plans - clean - power - ships 9 Designated Countries are those countries deemed to have robust environmental and social governance, legislation systems and i nstitutional capacity designed to protect their people and the natural environment.,Second - Party Opinion Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework 7 adequate measures and is well positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible categories. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All seven use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP. This section summarizes Sustainalytics’ research on the local context of key use cases listed in the Framework: Role of solid oxide fuel cell systems as backup and off - grid power in California The problem of power outages in California has reached catastrophic proportion s, with August 2020 witnessing the largest power outage in the state’s history , impacting an estimated 3.3 million people - more than twice the number affected in the second largest outage in 2001. 10 The primary reason is an exceptionally high demand resulting from a region - wide heat wave. 11 The state government typically meets such shortfalls through imports from neighboring states but the heat wave has affecte d several regions along the US west coast leaving little surplus energy for other states to export. 12 Such power outages disrupt business continuity and have a significant economic impact as well. Between October 2017 and 2019, an estimated 234,000 commer cial and industrial ( C&I ) customers were impacted in California due to power shutoffs 13 with each outage costing small C&I businesses up to an estimated $2.4 billion. 14 Stationary solid oxide fuel cells can serve as backup sources to power small installat ions in remote areas or , in an emergency , backup capacity for facilities that require consistent power, including large data centers. Given the critical need for backup sources of power in such areas, Sustainalytics views positively investments planned und er the Framework and recognizes their importance in the energy value chain . Environmental benefits of fuel cell systems and the importance of low - carbon fuels As discussed above, unmatched demand for power i s typically imported from neighbouring energy providers which are flexible but typically the least efficient energy sources. A study completed by DNV GL for Bloom Energy concluded that in the wholesale power market, the marginal generator of power with sur plus power is typically a CO 2 emitter and is generally the highest CO 2 emitter operating at any given time. In comparison, fuel cell systems not only have a lower carbon footprint but also the potential to generate 100% clean power if operated entirely on hydrogen or other carbon - neutral bio - based fuels . Sustainalytics notes that investments planned under this Framework include the sourcing of fuel (primarily natural gas) from decomposing waste at landfills through biogas plants. The output from such plan ts , known as Renewable Natural Gas (“RNG), is functionally identical to natural gas and has a similar direct emission profile. However, the lifecycle carbon intensity is much lower , and potentially even negative, as it sources its carbon content from waste matter that would decompose and be freely released into the atmosphere . The California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) certifies the lifecycle carbon intensities of various fuels; based on their data, the lifecycle carbon intensity of RNG is at least 40% less than traditional natural gas, while dairy waste and municipal solid waste digesters exhibit negative carbon intensities. 15 Sustainalytics believes that these investments along with others will contribute to further reducing the carbon intensity of Bloom’s fuel cell systems and thereby deliver positive environmental outcomes. Application of hydrogen as fuel in vehicles One of the key use cases for hydrogen fuel cells has been in the transportation sector with the onset of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). By combining hydrogen stored in a tank with oxygen from the air to produce electricity, such technologies emit only water and zero tailpipe emissions. 16 FCEVs are equi pped with notable energy efficiency features such as regenerative braking systems, which capture the energy lost during braking 10 Deadline report, California facing largest power outages in its history this week amid record heatwave, published on August 1 7, 2020 at: https://deadline.com/2020/08/california - the - largest - power - outages - in - its - history - this - week - 1203015664/ 11 Utility Dive opinion, California power outages underscore challenges of maintaining reliability during climate change, the en ergy transition, publishe d on August 19, 2020 at: https://www.utilitydive.com/news/california - power - outages - underscore - challenge - of - maintaining - reliability - du/583727/#:~:text=The%20principal%20cause%20of%20California's,reaching%20over%20100%20degrees%20Fahrenheit. 12 NPR report, Climate change lesson from California’s blackouts: prepare for extremes, published on August 19, 2020 at: https://www.npr.org/2020/08/19/903910770/clim ate - change - lesson - from - californias - blackouts - prepare - for - extremes 13 Bloom Energy website, California power outage map, published at: https://www.bloomenergy.com/bloom - energy - outage - map 14 Ibid 15 https://www.mjbradley.com/sites/default/files/MJB%26A_RNG_Final.pdf 16 Digital Trends, Hydrogen was the fuel of tomorrow, so what happened: https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/hydrogen - cars/,Second - Party Opinion Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework 8 and store it in a battery for future consumption. 17 According to the U.S. Department of Energy, while FCEVs and the hydrogen inf rastructure needed to fuel them are still in the early stages of wide - spread implementation, it has proven to be a viable and environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuel - powered transportation. 18 Given Bloom ’s intention to develop such technologies to accelerate the transition away from traditional gas and diesel vehicles, Sustainalytics notes the benefits of using hydrogen fuel cells in this context. The impact of green buildings in reducing GHG emissions According to the World Green Building Council, the building sector is a significant contributor to both global energy use and total CO 2 emissions, with building construction and operations accounting for 36% of global final energy use and contributing nearly 40% of energy - relate d CO 2 emissions globally. In the United States alone, residential and commercial buildings account for 39% of total U.S. energy consumption 19 and 72% of national electricity consumption. 20 The World Green Building Council states that while countries are continuing to implement and update building energy codes and certification policies, most expected building growth is expected in countries that do not have mandatory energy codes and polici es in place as of 2018. Concurrently, investments in energy efficiency in buildings has slowed, with investments only experiencing a growth of 4.7% in 2017 (3% adjusted for inflation), which is sited as the lowest increase rate in recent years. 21 In this c ontext, Bloom’s investments in corporate buildings which have received certification from international building rating and certification systems has the potential to significantly reduce GHG emissions associated with its overall operations. Alignment with / contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030.

Sustainalytics considers that the projects funded by the proceeds will provide positive environmental impact and in particular will support Bloom’s ability to deploy low - carbon fuel cell te chnology . The Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics bel ieves that the Framework is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the Company and that the use of proceeds categories will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 6, 7, 9, 11 ,12 and 13 . Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Bloom Energy is well - positioned to issue green bonds and that the Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles (20 18).,Second - Party Opinion Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework 10 Appendices Appendix 1: Comparison of Green Building Certification Schemes LEED 22 Energy Star 23 BREEAM 24 Background Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a US Certification System for residential and commercial buildings used worldwide. LEED was developed by the non - profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and covers the design, construction, mainten ance and operation of buildings. ENERGY STAR is a U.S Environmental Protection Agency voluntary program that provides independently certified energy efficiency ratings for products, homes, buildings, and industrial plants. Certification is given on an ann ual basis, so a building must maintain its high performance to be certified year to year. BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) was first published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in 1990. Based in the UK, t his scheme can be used for new, refurbished and extension of existing buildings. Certification levels • Certified • Silver • Gold • Platinum • 1 - 100 score, 75 is minimum for certification • Pass • Good • Very Good • Excellent • Outstanding Areas of assessment • Energy and atmosphere • Sustainable Sites • Location and Transportation • Materials and resources • Water efficiency • Indoor environmental quality • Innovation in Design • Regional Priority • Energy use • Management • Energy • Land Use and Ecology • Pollution • Transport • Materials • Water • Waste • Health and Wellbeing • Innovation Requirements Minimum requirements independent of level of certification; point - based scoring system weighted by category to determine certification level. The rating system is adjusted to apply to specific sectors, such as: New Construction, Major Renovation, Core an d Shell Development, Schools - /Retail - /Healthcare New Construction and Major Renovations, and Existing Buildings: Operation and Maintenance. 1 - 100 score based on energy use, as calculated through the Portfolio Manager tool. Raw score is adjusted based on l ocation, operating conditions, and other factors. The numerical score indicates performance better than at least 75 percent of similar buildings nationwide. Minimum requirements depending on the level of certification; scoring system weighted by category , producing a percentage - based overall score. The majority of BREEAM issues are flexible, meaning that the client can choose which to comply with to build their performance score. BREAAM has two stages/ audit reports: a ‘BREEAM Design Stage’ and a ‘Post Construction Stage’, with different assessment criteria. Qualitative Considerations Widely accepted within the industry, both in North America and internationally, and considered a guarantee of strong performance. Accounts only for energy use, not other measures of environmental performance. Is a key component of other green building certification systems. Used in more than 70 countries: Good adaptation to the local normative context.

Second - Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second - Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second - Party Opinion. It normally entails an as sessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification ma y focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestatio n regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can hav e its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredi ted third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified thir d parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion Bloom Energy Green Bond Framework 16 Disclaimer Copyright ©2020 Sustainalytics.
