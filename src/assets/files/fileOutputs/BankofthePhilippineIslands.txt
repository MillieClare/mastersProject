© Sustainalytics 201 9 Second - Party Opinion Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework Evaluation Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework is credible and impactful and aligns with the compon ents of the Green Bond Principles 2018 , the Green Loan Principles and the ASEAN Green Bond Standards. This assessment is based on the following: The eligible categor ies for the use of proceeds – (i) Renewable Energy, (ii) Energy Efficie ncy, (iii) Sustainable Water & Wastewater Management, (iv) Pollution Prevention & Control, (v) Green B uildings are aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond Principles and the Green Loan Principles. Sustainalytics considers that the Eligible Green Pr ojects will contribute to the reduction of the Philippines ’ environmental footprint and advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals 6, 7 , 9 , 11 and 12 . BPI ’s Sus ta inable Energy Finance and Specialized Lendin g Unit Team ( together “SEF/SLT”) are responsible for the initial project selection. All selected projects are to be approved by the SEF / SLT Head and Vice Chairman of the Green Finan ce Committee (“GFC”), while the latter committee convenes semi - annually in order to eval uate alignment with eligibility criteria. This process is in line with market practices. BPI established a register to track and monitor the allocation and use of proceeds for the green bond transactions. Pending full allocation, the unallocated proceeds will be managed in accordance with BPI’s internal liquidity management policies. Sustainal ytics views this process as aligned with market practices. BPI has committed to disclose an annual allocation report as part of BPI’s Integrated Annual and Sustainability Report. The (i) allocation report will include the list of Eligible Green Projec ts, allocated amounts and the remaining unallocated proceeds. W here relevant and feasible, BPI will disclose (ii) impact report ing on the environmental outcomes of Eligible Green Projects through a series of KPIs tailored for each Eligible Green Project Ca tegory , as part of the same BPI Integrated Annual and Sustainability Report. Sustainalytics views BPI’s allocation reporting commit ments to be in line with market practices and encourages BPI to disclose impact reporting on an annual basis. Alignment wi th the ASEAN Green Bond Standards The ASEAN Green Bond Standards provide guidance to issuers and communicate more specifically abou t what an issuer should do to issue credible green bonds within Southeast Asia. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Eli gible Green Project Categories under the Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework align with the ASEAN Green Bond St andards.

Together with its subsidiaries, BPI operates three segments: Consumer Banking, Corporate Banking and Investment Ba n king. BPI was founded in 1851 and is headquartered in Makati City, the Philippines. BPI has developed the Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework (the “ F ramework ”) under which it intends to issue green bonds and green l oans and use the proceeds to finance and/or refinance in whole or in part, existing and/or future projects that will deliver positive environmental outcomes and which advance the company’s sustainability mission. The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in five areas : 1. Renewable Energy 2. Energy Efficiency 3. Sustainable Water & Wastewater Management 4. Pollution Prevention & Control 5. Green Buildings BPI engaged Sustainalytics to review the Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework dated May 2019 and provide a second - party opinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 ( “ GBP ” ) 1 and the Green Loan Principles (“GLP”) 2 , as well as the ASEAN Green Bond Standards (AGBS) 3 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 4 As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics exchanged information with various members of BPI’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of BPI’s green bond s and green loans. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of th e Bank of the Philippine Islands Gre en Finance Framework and should be read in conjunction with th at F ramework. 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - soci al - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ 2 The Green Lo an Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at: https://www.lma.eu.com/application/files /9115/4452/5458/741_LM_Green_Loan_Principles_Booklet_V8.pdf 3 The ASEAN Green Bond Standards are administered by the ASEAN Green Bond Standards, and are available at: http:/ /www.theacmf.org/ACMF/upload/ASEAN_Green_Bond_Standards.pdf 4 The Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework is available on BPI’s website at: https://www.bpi.com.ph/,Seco nd - Party Opinion Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework 3 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that th e Ban k of the Philippine Islan ds Green Finance Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the components of the GBP , GLP and AGBS . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of the Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework . Use of Proceeds: • The Bank of the Philippine Islands intends to finance projects aligned with the Green Finance Framework categories – (i) Renewable Energy, (ii) Energy Efficiency, (iii) Sustainable Water & Wastewater Management, (iv) Pollution Prevention and Control, (v) Gre en Buildings . These categories are recognized as impactful by the GBP, GLP and AGBS . Sustainalytics believes that the Eligible Green Projects will support the growth of renewable energy , as well as improved energy efficiency . Similarly, Sus tainalytics cons iders that the projects contemplated will provide quality improvements in the standards on the built environment in the Philippines . • Sustainalytics positively notes that the net proceeds of any BPI Green Bond and/or Loan will not be used t owards financing and/or refinancing of fossil fuel related assets and activities aligned with the AGBS. • BPI limits refinancing to financing originally made within two and a half years of the issue date of each relevant Green Bond, which is aligned with mar ket practice. BP I does not disclose a period in which it intends to allocate the full Use of Proceeds. • BPI’s green buildings eligibility criteria are based on third - party certification standards such as LEED “Gold” standard or above , IFC’s EDGE Certified or EDGE Complian t Buildings standard , or any other national equivalent such as BERDE , indicating a strong alignment with both local and green finance market standards. Sustainalytics made an assessment of the certifications and considers these schemes to b e credible and e nsuring the proper integration of environmental consideration during all stages of a building’s lifecycle. (See Appendix 2 for additional details on the certification schemes). • BPI confirmed to Sustainalytics that its waste management proj ects follow the waste hierarchy. Project Selection Process: • BPI’s project evaluation and selection process is executed through the Sustainable Energy Finance and Specialized Lending Unit Team (“SEF/SLT”) responsible for the initial identificati on, evaluation and nomination of potential projects. Final sign - off is to be performed by the SEF / SLT Head along with the Vice - Chairman of the Green Finance Committee, which meets semi - annually to validate compliance of the projects with t he initial e ligibility criteria. Sustainalytics assesses this process to be aligned with market practices. Management of Proceeds: • BPI confirmed that a dedicated register will be set - up to monitor and track the allocation and use of proceeds. The regi ster will in clude relevant green bond transaction details along with Eligible Green Project list and other details. Pending full allocation, the unallocated proceeds will be managed according to BPI’s internal liquidity management policies, be invested in cash or cash equivalents, or used to repay credit facilities within BPI or its subsidiaries. Sustainalytics views this process to be in line with market practices. Reporting: • BPI commits to disclose an annual allocation report as part of BPI’s Sustai nability Rep ort. The (i) allocation reporting will include information relative to the list of approved Eligible Green Projects, the allocated amounts, as well as the remaining balance of unallocated proceeds. BPI intends to have its allocation reporting e xternally au dited, which is in line with market best practices. With regards to the (ii) impact reporting, BPI will report where feasible and possible, on the environmental outcomes of its investments with KPIs tailored for each Eligible Green Project Cate gory, such a s GHG emissions reduced or avoided (in CO 2e ), annual energy savings (in kWh / MWh/GWh), level of certification achieved by the green building, number of waste processed in the facility (in tonnes), annual volume of wastewater treated or avoided ( in l/m 3 ), am ong others. Sustainalytics views BPI’s,Seco nd - Party Opinion Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework 4 allocation reporting commitments to be in line with market practices and encourages BPI to disclose impact re porting on an annual basis. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 , Green Loan Principles and ASEAN Gr een Bond Standards Sustainalytics has determined that BPI’s green bonds and green loans align to the components of the GBP , GLP and AGBS 2018 . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 2 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. The AGBS provide guidance to issuers and communicate more specifically what an issuer should do to issue a credible green bond within Southeast Asi a. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework aligns with the AGBS . See Appendix 1: Alignment to the AGBS . Section 2: Sustainability Performance of the Issuer Contribution of the framework to the issuer’s sustainability mandate BPI has confirmed to Sustainalytics that the company has committed to support and integrate sustainability finance into its core bank ing operations and investments . BPI has invested in renewable energy projects, energy efficiency projects and green buildings projects through (i) loans, (ii) leasing operations, and (iii) trad e finance. Sustainalytics highlights that BPI has already allocated around PHP 1 25 billion (USD around 2 .4 billion) in cumulative disbursements to its Energy and Climate Resilience Portfolio strictl y to renewable energy, energy efficiency and climate resil ience projects . 5 Similarly, BPI confirmed to Sustainalytics that the company implemented a 15% energy efficiency target based on the ESCO standards in the Philippines, without however offering a tim eline on the delivery of the environmental objective. As s uch, Sustainalytics considers BPI to be well positioned to issue green bonds and loans and believes that green bond/loan issuance can help advance the Bank’s sustainability strategy. Well positio ned to address common environmental and social risks assoc iated with the projects While the eligible use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized as impactful by the GBP, GLP and AGBS , Sustainalytics acknowledges that the E ligible P rojects bear environmental and social risks related to biodiversi ty and land use change for large scale renewable energy plants , transmissions systems , and building projects , as well as community relations risks and health and safety . Sustainalytics highlights th e following measures that BPI has taken to mitigate the na med risks: - BPI confirmed to Sustainalytics that all loans in the Sustainability Portfolio are subjected to (i) a technical and financial evaluation conducted by third - party trained & accredited consultants or other third - party consultants engaged by the borrower and the lender as part of the loan application process. - Additionally, all eligible projects financed a re required to submit (ii) an Environmental Clearance Certificate 6 or a Certificate o f Non - Coverage 7 (or similar) issued by the respective regio nal office of the Philippines Department of Environmental & Natural Resources. 8 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that BPI’s loan screening process helps the company to mitigate environmental risks related to the Use of Proceeds and encourages BPI to also include screening of social aspects. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All five use of proceeds cate gories are recognized as impactful by GBP. Sustainalytics has focused on three below where the impact is specifically relevant in local context. 5 BPI 2018 Integrate d Annual and Sustainability Report available at: https://www.bpi.com.ph/about/investor - relations/annual - reports 6 Document available at : http://ecac.emb.gov.ph/?pag e_id=270/#ecc 7 Document available at : http://ecac.emb.gov.ph/?page_id=270/#ecc 8 Website available at: https://www.denr.gov.ph/,Seco nd - Party Opinion Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework 5 I mportance of renewable energy production and GHG emission reduction from buildings BPI has confirmed to Sustainalytics that the largest portion of the green transactions’ proceeds will be allocated towards the financing and refinancing of renewable energ y production projects and green buildings. Currently, the Philippines derive s more th an 74% of its energy requirements from fossil fuels (natural gas and coal) , 16% 9 from hydropower sources, and the remaining 10% from geothermal sources. 10 The high percenta ge of fossil fuel based energy indicates the importance to foster renewable energy to decarbonize the countries energy system. Moreover, t he country has implemented a public target to install additional 4.7 GW of renewable energy facilities by 2030. 11 Sep a rately, according to studies conducted by the International Finance Corporation, buildings in the Philippines consumed 36% of the country’s electricity and accounted for more than 25% of the total GHG emissions, as of 2018, 12 mostly due to insufficient ene rgy efficiency standards. However, the country outlined the Philippin es Energy Efficiency Roadmap 2017 – 2040, 13 implementing objectives, policies and programs relative to the dissemination and expansion of energy efficiency measures across the real estate sector. It is in this sense that Sustainalytics considers that BPI’s energy efficiency projects are aligned with the efforts and policies of the Philippines government, and create the context for the generalization of environmentally conscious buildings co ntributing to the reduction of the country’s GHG emissions. Importa nce of Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management projects in the Philippines Current statistics from the Philippines’ Environmental Management Bureau indicate that only 10% of the cou ntry’s wastewater is treated, 58% of the groundwater is contaminated. 14 The major sources of water pollution is inadequately treated domestic wastewater or sewage (48%) and agricultural wastewater (37%) , which are also the main cause for waterborne diseases . I n the capital city and second largest metropolitan region in the P hilippines, the Metropolitan Manila, only 11% of the 1 4 million inhabitants are connected to a sewerage system, 15 85% of the people are served by two million septic tanks, while the remain ing 4% ha ve no access to toilets . Given the context, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that BPI’s financing of Sustainable Water & Wastewater Management projects can provide a meaningful contribution to the acute issue of untreated wastewater and groundwa ter pollution. Sustainalytics theref ore considers that the proposed projects will help the Philippines to increase clean water access . Importance of Pollution Prevention and Control in the Philippines The World Bank estimated that urban waste volumes in the Philippines will increase by 165% from 2012 to 2020 to 77,776 tonnes per day from an estimated 29,315 tonnes (2012) largely due to a projected 47.3% increase in local urban populations, as well as a projected doubling of municipal solid waste generati on per capita . 16 The Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 dictate s that all open dumpsites must be converted into sanitary landfills by 200 6, 17 there are still more than 425 illegal dumpsites across the country, while the 139 sanitary landfills in o peration handle waste streams from just 308 of the 1,634 local government 9 Executive Summary.

Green Buildings 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure 9.4 By 2030, upgrade infrastruc ture and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, while increasing resource - use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial p rocesses, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respect ive capabilities. Conclusion Bank of the Philippine Islands has developed the Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework which it will use to finance and/or refina nce a broad range of projects and assets related to (i) Renewable Energy, (i i) Energy Efficiency, (iii) Sustainable Water & Wastewater Management, (iv) Pollution Prevention and Control and (v) Green Buildings. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that BPI’s El igible Green Project Categories have a positive environmental impact and con tribute to a reduction of the Philippines’ environmental footprint. Sustainalytics considers that the Framework is aligned with the GBP, GLP and AGBS. BPI’s processes for project selection and evaluation, management of proceeds and reporting are in line with market practices . Additionally, Sustainalytics highlights that BPI uses internationally recognized third - party green building certification schemes such as LEED and IFC’s EDGE scheme. Based on the above, Sustainalytics considers that the Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework is robust, transparent and in alignment with market practices and the GBP, GLP and AGBS . 18 ECO Business, Philippines central government on solving plastic trash problem: ‘We’ve done all we can’, 2018: Information retrieved from https://www.eco - business.com/news/philippines - central - government - on - solving - plastic - trash - pr oblem - weve - done - all - we - can/ 19 Information retrieved from https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/06/15/1824813/philippines - 3rd - largest - contributor - ocean - plastic and the Ocean Conservancy and Mckinsey report “Stemmi ng the Tide: Land - based strategies for a plastic - free ocean” available at: https://oceanconservancy.org/wp - content/uploads/2017/04/full - report - stemming - the. pdf,Seco nd - Party Opinion Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework 7 Appendices Appendix 1: Alignment to the ASEAN Green Bond Standards ASEAN Green Bond Standards’ Criteria Alignment wi th ASEAN GBS Sustainalytics’ comments on alignment with the ASEAN Green Bond Standards 20 Eligibility Yes The AGBS requires that issuers must be located in or that the proceeds be directed to assets in an ASEAN country. As a Philippine - based institution , the Bank of the Philippine Islands qualifies. Use of Proceeds Yes The AGBS offers specific clarification that fossil fuel power generation projects are excluded . BPI in its framework states that ‘ The net proceeds of any BPI Green Bond and/or Loan shal l not be used towards financing and/or refinancing of fossil fuel related assets and activities ’. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection Yes The AGBS specifies information that must be clearly communicated to investors before issuance regarding pr oject selection. Within its framework, Bank of the Philippine Islands has described that BPI’s Sustainable Energy Finan ce and Specialized Lending Unit Team (together “SEF/SLT”) are responsible for the initial project selection. All selected projects are to be approved by the SEF SLT Head and Vice Chairman of the Green Finance Committee (“GFC”), while the latter comm ittee convenes semi - annually in order to evaluate alignment with eligibility criteria . Management of Proceeds Yes The AGBS mandates that proceeds must be appropriately tracked and that temporary investments be disclosed. Within its framework, Bank of the Philippine Islands disclosed that it established a register to track and monitor the allocation and use of proceeds for the green bon d transactions. Pending full allocation, the unallocated proceeds will be managed in accordance with BPI’s internal liq uidity management policies , be invested in cash or cash equivalents, or used to repay credit facilities within BPI or its subsidiaries. Reporting Yes The AGBS requires annual reporting on the allocation of funds and the expected impacts. Bank of the Philippine Islands states that it will provide an annual allocation report until full allocation and where relevant and possible report s on the impact of the use of proceeds. Annual Review Yes The AGBS encourages, but does not require, annual reviews. Bank of the Philippine Islands states that f or each Green Bond issuance, it intend s to engage an external auditor to provide independent v erification on our reporting and management of proceeds in accordance with this Framework 20 The ASEAN Green Bond Principles are available at: http://www.theacmf.org/ACMF/upload/GREENBONDACMF.pdf,Seco nd - Party Opinion Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework 8 Appendix 2 : Comparison of green building certification schemes LEED 21 EDGE 22 BERDE 23 Background Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a US Certification System for residential and commercial buildings used worldwide. LEED was developed by the non - profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and covers the design, construction, maintenance and operation of buildings. EDGE (or “Excellence i n Design for Greater Efficiencies”) is a green building standard and certification system developed by the International Finance Corporation and applicable in 140 countries. BERDE (Building for Ecologically Responsive Design Excellence) is a dministered by the Philippine Green Building Council (PhilGBC ) and is recognized by the Philippine Department of Energy.

Requirem ents Prerequisites (independent of level of certification) + Credits with associated points These points are then added together to obtain the LEED level of certification There are several different rating systems within LEED. Each rating sys tem is d esigned to apply to a specific sector (e.g. New Construction, Major Renovation, Core and Shell Development, Schools - /Retail - /Healthcare New Construction and Major Renovations, Existing Buildings: Operation and Maintenance). To achieve the EDGE s tandard, a building must demonstrate a minimum 20% reduction in operational energy consumption, water use and embodied energy in materials as compared to typical local practices. Minimum requirements + Points Projects applying for BERDE Certification must comply with the minimum requirements before an assessment can begin. Afterwards, the project is analyzed on the 9 areas of assessment and receives points depending on performance. The distribution of points for the areas of assessment is different dependi ng on th e certification type (BERDE GBRS New Construction, BERDE GBRS Operations and BERDE GBRS Renovations). Based on the total number of points, a certain number of stars are awarded to the project. The minimum rating for a project,Seco nd - Party Opinion Bank of the Philippine Islands Green Finance Framework 10 to be certified is 51 points ( 1 Star).
