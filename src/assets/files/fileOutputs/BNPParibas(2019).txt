C O M / E S G 3 o f 2 5 Overall Evaluation of the Green Bond BNP Paribas commissioned ISS - oekom to assist with its Green Bond by assessing th ree core elements to determine the sustainability quality of the Bond: 1. BNP Paribas ’s Green Bond framework – benchmarked against the International Capital Market Association's ( ICMA ) Green Bond Principles (GBPs ). 2. The asset pool – whethe r the projects aligned with ISS - oekom’s issue - specific key performance indicators (KPIs) (See Annex 2 ). 3. BNP Paribas ’s sustainability performance , according to the ISS - oekom C orporate R ating. ISS - oekom ASSESSMENT SUMMARY 1 The ISS - oekom’s present evaluation will remain valid until any modification of the Green Bond Framework or addition of new assets into the asset pool by the issuer and as long as the issu er’s Corporate Rating does not change (last modification on the 17.06.2019). The controversy check of the underlying assets has been conducted on the 23 .08.2019. SPO SECTION SUMMARY EVALUATION 1 Part 1: Performance against the GBPs The issuer has defined a formal concept for its Green Bonds regarding use of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the ICMA GBPs . Po sitive Part 2: Sustainability quality of the asset pool The overall sustainability quality of the asset pool in terms of sustainability benefit s, risk avoidance and minimisation is good based upon the ISS - oekom Green Bond KPIs. The Green Bond KPIs contain a clear description of eli gible asset categories which include wind power, solar power (PV and CSP), water supply , smart energy and commercial real estate . Most of the assets of the asset pool are located in highly regulated and developed countries . Legislative frameworks in those countries set minimum standards, which reduce e nvironmental and social risks. Positive Part 3: Issuer sustainability performance The issuer itself shows a good sustainability performance and has been classified as ‘Prime’ within the methodology of the ISS - oekom Corporate Rating. It is rate d 7 th out of 267 companies within its sector as of 07. 11 .2019.

C O M / E S G 4 o f 2 5 Contribution of the Green Bond to the UN SDGs Based on the assessment of the sustainability quality of the green bond asset pool and using a proprietary methodology, ISS - oekom assessed the contribution of the BNP Paribas ’s green bond to the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations ( UN SDGs). This assessment is displayed on 5 - point scale (see Annex 2 for methodology): Significant Obstruction Limited Obstruction No Net Impact Limited Contribution Significant Contribution Each of the green bond’s Use of Proceeds categories has been assessed for its contribution to, or obstruction of , the SDGs: USE OF PROCEEDS CATEGORY CONTRIBUTION OR OBSTRUCTION SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPM ENT GOALS Wind power (onshore and offshore ) Significant contribution Solar power (PV) Significant contribution Solar power (CSP) Significant contribution Water supply Significant contribution Limited contribution Smart energy Significant contribution Real estate (commercial) S ignificant contribution,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus ta i na bility Qua lity of the Gr een Bond As s et Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 5 o f 2 5 ISS - oekom SPO ASSESSMENT PART I: GREEN BOND PRINCIPLES 1. Use of Proceeds In accordance with BNP Paribas Group’s policy to contribute to energy transition solutions and in line with the Green Bond Principles, BNP Paribas has identified sectors with a positive impact on the environment for the Green Bond Framework (the Eligible C ategories). The complete list of Eligible Categories, Eligible Green Assets associated and the environmental objectives can be found in the BNP Paribas’ Green Bond Framework 2 . The proceeds of the Green Bond will be exclusively used to (re - )finance projects falling in the categories of renewable energy (offshore and onshore wind, concentrated solar power and solar photovoltaic), energy efficiency, green buildings and water management and water treatment as defined by BNP Paribas’ Green Bond Framework. The ta ble below details the share of each asset category of the selected asset pool as of 07.11.2019. ASSET CATEGORY VOLUME IN MILLION EUROS SHARE OF THE ASSET POOL Renewable energy 1,089 51.93% Offshore and onshore wind 761 36.29% Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) 301 1.47% Solar photovoltaic (PV) 297 14.17% Energy efficiency 15 0.71% Green buildings 947 45.16% Water management and water treatment 46 2.19% TOTAL 2,096 100% Further information is available in the BNP Paribas’ Green Bond Framework. Opinion: ISS - oekom considers the Use of Proceeds description provided by the BNP Paribas’ Green Bond Framework as aligned with the GBPs. The prescribed categories are all within the GBPs and the exclusions ensure further adherence to the standard. 2 BNP Paribas full Green Bond Framework is available on the following webpage: https://invest.bnpparibas.com/en/debts/senior - unsecured - green - bond - issues/green - bonds - framework,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus ta i na bility Qua lity of the Gr een Bond As s et Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 6 o f 2 5 2. Proce ss for Project Evaluation and Selection The Eligible Green Assets are sourced from the various Eligible Categories and are selected following the application of the Eligibility Criteria defined in BNP Paribas’ Green Bond Framework . This identification and selection is a two - step process which encompasses internal screening selection and external review by third parties as described in paragraph External Reviews . The internal screening selection conducted by BNP Paribas to identify Eligible Green Assets asse sses the potential ESG risks in line with its framework, including specific ESG risks assessment tools and the Equator Principles. C ommon risks associated with all green assets categories (e.g. Human Rights, Pollution, Workforce Health and Safety, Social condition of the Workforce and Governance) are considered while selecting the Eligible Green Assets . These are then complemented by specific risk s consideration for different Green Assets categories. In addition, further screening is applied to exclude non - committed transactions, loans on watchlists and assets pledged to other green financing programmes. Recognizing that the Green Bond Principles and best practi ces are evolving, BNP Paribas would always consider the appropriate selection criteria at the time of any Green Bond issuance and w ill seek to be in line with best market practices. Further information is available in the BNP Paribas’ Green Bond Framework . Opinion: ISS - oekom finds that the process for Project Evaluation and Selection aligns with the GBPs , including the commitment to evolve in meeting best market practices . 3. Management of Proceeds A single common pool of Eligible Green Assets BNP Paribas intends to accrue over time a single common pool of diversified Eligible Green Assets from the various Eligible Sectors subject to internal selection (as per the section ‘Selection of Assets’) and verification by appropriate independent third p arties. This single common pool of Eligible Green Assets will represent all Green Bond issues under the Green Bond Framework. Ultimately Eligible Green Assets may be diversified to stem from the various Eligible Sectors that will be added to BNP Paribas’ s ingle common pool of Eligible Green Assets. BNP Paribas will monitor the use of the net proceeds of the Securities via its internal information systems. BNP Paribas will use its best efforts to substitute any redeemed loans or any other form of financing that are no longer financed or refinanced by the net proceeds and/or if any such loans or any other form of financing cease to be an Eligible Green Asset, as soon as practicable once an appropriate substitution option has been identified. Unallocated proc eeds Pending the allocation or reallocation, as the case may be, of the net proceeds of the Securities to Eligible Green Assets , BNP Paribas will invest the balance of the net proceeds , at its own discretion, cash and/or cash equivalent , and/or other liquid marketable instruments .,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus ta i na bility Qua lity of the Gr een Bond As s et Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 7 o f 2 5 Governance As an integral part of its governance for Green Bonds, BNP Paribas has set up a Green Bond Committee, bringing together various departments within the bank to supervise the issuance of the Green Bo nds, the selection and monitoring of the pool of the Eligible Green Assets and to ensure the compliance of the Green Bonds with best practices. T he role of the Green Bond Committee is t o review and validate the pool of Eligible Green Assets; t o validate t he annual reporting for investors; t o review the appropriate external independent auditors’ report and address any issues arising; and t o monitor any on - going evolution related to Green Bond market practices in terms of disclosure/reporting, harmonization. The Green Bond Committee will meet on a semi - annual basis and is chaired by the Head of Corporate Social Responsibility for BNP Paribas. Members of the Green Bond Committee will include the following departments: Relevant business lines , Corpo rate S ocial Responsibility department, Asset and Liability Management Treasury department and Sustainable Capital Markets . Any other teams deemed necessary to be represented may also be included. Further information is available in the BNP Paribas’ Green Bond Framework. Opinion: ISS - oekom finds the Management of Proceeds according to BNP Paribas ’s Green Bond Framework to be aligned with the GBPs . This particularly involves the use of internal information systems. 4. Reporting Annual reporting As long as any Green Bond is outstanding, BNP Paribas will report at least annually on: • The Eligible Green Assets financed or refinanced by the net proceeds and their relevant environmental impact indicators; • The allocation of the Securities’ net proceeds to Eligible Green Assets detailing the aggregate amount dedicated to each of the Eligible Sectors; and • The balance of unallocated cash and/or cash equivalent and/or other liquid marketable instruments still h eld by BNP Paribas. The annual reporting will present the aggregation of the Eligible Green Assets per Eligible Sector and per technology, where applicable, and will be subject to permitted disclosure in accordance with relevant confidentiality agreements and competition issues. The annual reporting is intended to follow the guidelines of the Green Bond Principles, as amended from time to time, and the reference framework “Working towards a harmonized framework for Green Bond impact reporting” dated June 2019 . In particular, BNP Paribas intends to report on the impact of the Eligible Green Assets where applicable. There will be a single annual report for all Green Bond issuances under the Green Bond Framework. The first annual report was published on the anniversary date of the first issuance. Any future report will be published thereafter on the anniversary date of this first report.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus ta i na bility Qua lity of the Gr een Bond As s et Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

C O M / E S G 2 4 o f 2 5 ANNEX 2 : Methodology ISS - oekom Green Bond KPIs The ISS - oekom Green Bond KPIs serves as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality – i.e. the social and environmental added value – of the use of proceeds of BNP Paribas ’ s Green Bond. It comprises firstly the definition of the use of proceeds category offering added social and/or environmental value, and secondly the specific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the a ssets can be clearly identified and described. The sustainability criteria are complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measurement of the sustainability performance of the assets and which can also be used for reporting. To review t he KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Federico Pezzolato (details below ) who will send them directly to you. Asset evaluation methodology ISS - oekom evaluates whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eligible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bond KPIs. All percentages refer to the amount of assets within one category (e.g. wind power). Additionally, the assessment “no or limited information is available” either indicates that no information was made available to ISS - oekom or that the information provided did not fulfil the requirements of the ISS - oekom Green Bond KPIs. The evaluation was carried out using information and documents provided to ISS - oekom on a confidential basis by BNP Paribas (e.g. Due Diligence Reports). Fur ther, national legislation and standards, depending on the asset location , were drawn on to complement the information provided by the issuer. Assessment of the contribution and association to the SDG The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endors ed in September 2015 by the United Nations and provide a benchmark for key opportunities and challenges toward a more sustainable future . Using a proprietary method, ISS - oekom identifies the extent to which BNP Paribas ’s Green Bond contributes to related S DGs and has a positive association with their respective sub - targets . The c ontribution assessment is split into two Levels: 1. Level 1: Contribution and/or obstruction of the Use of Proceeds cat egories to be financed through the bond to the UN SDGs 2. Level 2: Association of the assets’ ESG performance with further SDGs,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus ta i na bility Qua lity of the Gr een Bond As s et Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

The agency analyses companies and countries regarding their environmental and social performance. As part of our Sustainable ( Green & Social) Bond Services, we provide support for companies and institutions issuing sustainable bonds, advise them on the selection of categories of projects to be financed and help them to define ambitious criteria. We assess alignment with external prin ciples (e.g. the ICMA Green / Social Bond Principles), analyse the sustainability quality of the assets and review the sustainability performance of the issuer themselves. Following these three steps, we draw up an independent SPO so that investors are as well informed as possible about the quality of the bond / loan from a sustainability perspective .
