The guidelines co mmunicate what an issuer should do to issue a credible green bond, and also highlight what an issuer is recommended to do. Sustainalytics asses sed the alignment between the Framework and the ‘requirements of’ items outlined in the Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2017.,Second - Party Opinion Seiko Epson Corporation Green Bond Framework 2 Introdu ction Seiko Epson Corporation (“ Seiko Epson ” or “the Company”) is a manufacturer of electronic products that include printers, scanners, projectors, clocks and watches, industrial robots, microdevices, and other items. The C ompany started overseas production in 1968 in Singapore and now has a worldwide sales, service , production and development network. Sales outside Japan accounted for 77% of consolidated sales in fiscal 2018. Seiko Epson has developed the Seiko Epson Corporation Green Bond Framework under which it intends to issue green bonds and use the proceeds to finance and/or refinance, eligible green projects that generate positive environmental impact in Japan and abroad . The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in the following areas: 1. Eco - efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes ( C apital expenditures and R&D expenditures associated with manufacturing printers and multifunction printers with improved energy efficiency a nd papermaking system s that makes paper from used office paper . ) 2. Pollution prevention and control 3. Sustainable water and wastewater management 4. Renewable Energy Seiko Epson engaged Sustainalytics to review the Framework , dated November 2019 and provide a second - party opinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the GBP 1 and Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2017. A summary overview of this Framework has been provided in Appendix 1. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Seiko Epson ’s Management and Finance Department to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework . Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with th at F ramework. 1 International Capital Market Association (ICMA), “ The Green Bond Principles 2018”, at : https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bon ds/green - bond - principles - gbp/,Second - Party Opinion Seiko Epson Corporation Green Bond Framework 3 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Seiko Epson Corporation Green Bond Framework Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the GBP . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of the F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible categories for the use of proceeds, 1) Eco - efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and ; 2) P ollution prevention and reduction; 3) Sustainable water and wastewater management; and 4) R enewable energy, are recognized as project categories with positive environmental benefits in GBP. For additional information, please see Section 3 for Sustainalytics’ assessment of positive environmental benefits of the use of proceeds. - Seiko Epson will allocate the proceeds to capital expenditures and R&D expend itures associated with the manufacture of printers and multifunction printers and components of these products that reduce the consumption of electricity. The C ompany has committed that these products and components will improve energy efficiency in the ra nge of 75 - 90% compared with products from other companies with similar specifications ( The electricity consumption of Epson’s high - speed linehead inkjet multifunction printers for offices are approximately 1/8 compared with products from other companies with same specifications , and the figure for Epson’s high - capacity ink - tank printers are approximately 1/10 . For Epson’s commerc ial and industrial digital textile printers, the production process is shortened to 3 days - 2 weeks which was 1.5 – 2 months compared with analog textile printing ) . Sustainalytics believes that the energy efficiency outlined in the F ramework will have clear environmental benefits and contribute to achieving a low - carbon economy. Furthermore, Seiko Epson plans to allocate the proceeds to R&D activities and manufacturi ng equipment for a machine that makes new paper from used office paper. Reuse of paper will help the promotion of a recycling - oriented economic system by utilizing recycle d resources and thereby reducing the volume of waste material. - In the pollution prevention and reduction category, Seiko Epson intend s to allocate the proceeds in the operation of its recycling system. The system will collect and recycle used inkjet cartridges as well as printers, projectors and PCs and the materials obtained from these items will be reused for the manufacture of Seiko Epson products. - While t he proceeds will also be allocated to expenditures for water quality conservation by the treatment and reuse of effluents from Seiko Epson production processes, th ese expenditures will contribute to the reduction of water pollution. - Under the renewable energy category, Seiko Epson intend s to allocate the proceeds to purchasing electricity generated from renewable sources. Sustainalytics recognizes that investors gen erally prefer capital expenditures in renewable energy and there are limitations to the environmental benefits from the use of proceeds. However , considering the Company’s business model and its target which aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with its business activities by 19% from FY2017 to FY2025, Sustainalytics views positively that the purchase and advanc ement of renewable energy will have environ mental benefits. - Seiko Epson intend s to allocate the proceeds to financ ing and refinanc ing expenses , and t he look - back period for refinancing is set to be within the three - years prior to the issu ance date of the green bonds. Sustainalytics believes that Seiko Epson’s three - year look - back period is aligned with market practice, as investors generally prefer refinancing for new projects with a look - back period of two to three years. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - The candidate p rojects for Seiko Epson’s use of proceeds will be selected by the Management and Finance Department upon discussion with the C ustomers’ S atisfaction Quality and,Second - Party Opinion Seiko Epson Corporation Green Bond Framework 4 Environment Planning Division and CSR/CSV Promotion Division based on the eligibility criteria, and then examined by the Corporate Strategy Council. Final decisions will be made by the CFO. The evaluation and selection process are aligned with market pract ice. • Management of Proceeds: - The allocated and unallocated amounts of proceeds will be tracked and managed quarterly by the Management and Finance Department of the C ompany, using an internal management system. Unallocated proceeds will be held in cash o r cash equivalents. Sustainalytics views the process for the management of proceeds to be aligned with market practice. • Reporting: − Seiko Epson intends to publish annually the allocation of proceeds and the environmental positive impacts on its website unt il bond maturity , and when necessary in case of material developments . Allocation reporting will include a brief description of allocated projects, the amount of proceeds allocated and unallocated, and the percentage of proceeds allocated to financing and refinancing . Impact reporting will include the environmental performance of finished products (in the case of components, the finished products that use the components), CO 2 emission reduction based on the number of items shipped, the amount of renewable energy purchased and associated CO 2 emission reduction, and the number of research papers . − Seiko Epso n commits to receive a n annual compliance review from Sustainalytics as an independent external provider, to confirm the alignment of use of proceeds and impact reporting with the F ramework. Sustainalytics believes that its commitment to obtaining compliance reviews by independent external organizations, in addition to allocation and impact reporting, is in line with market best practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that Seiko Epson ’s Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP .

In addition, the F ramework explains the eligible criteria for use of proceeds as well as the project evaluation and selection process in which the CFO makes the final decisions. 3. Management of Proceeds Yes Amount of proceeds allocated and unallocated will be tracked and managed by the Management and Finance Department of the C ompany quarterly , using an internal management system. Unallocated proceeds will be held in cash or cash equivalents. The F ramework explains the abovementioned management of proceeds . 4. Reporting Yes Seiko Epson intends to publish annually the allocation of proceeds and the e nvironmental impact on its website until bond maturity , and when necessary in case of material developments. As its impact report ing , Seiko Epson intends to disclose indicators including the environmental performance of finished products (in the case of components, the finished products that use the components), CO 2 emission reduction based on the number of items shipped, the amount of renewable energy purchased and associated CO 2 emission reduction, and the number of research papers . Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of the Issuer Contribution of framework to issuer’s sustainability strategy Under its management philosophy 4 , Seiko Epson has the goal of becoming an indispensable C ompany and commits to contributing to the creation of a sustainable society by achieving the goals of its Environmental Vision 2050 5 , a long - term vision. The C ompany has identified six mat eriality themes in order to solve social issues through business activities and specified “ Achieve Sustainability in a Circular Economy ” as the one theme. 6 At the same time, Seiko Epson also recognizes “ Contributing to the environment through products and services”, “ Effective use of energy and resources”, and “ Climate change and global warming” as key CSR themes. For these themes, the C ompany has established targets as follows and is taking actions to achieve these goals. 4 Seiko Epson, “Management Philosophy”, at: https://global.epson.com/company/epson_way/management/ 5 Seiko Epson, “Environmental Vision 2050”, at: https://global.epson.com/SR/environment/vision/ 6 Seiko Epson, “Key CSR Themes”, at: https://global.epson.com/SR/csr_initiative/action_items.html,Second - Party Opinion Seiko Epson Corporation Green Bond Framework 6 Eco - efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes In line with the key CSR theme, “ Contributing to the environment through products and services”, Seiko Epson has set the target of a 44% reduction by FY2025 in scope 3 (category 1 (pu rchased goods and services) and category 11 (use of products sold)) in GHG emissions. This target has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBT i ). 7 To achieve this target, Seiko Epson has implemented the Design for Environment and has been developing products with high energy efficiency. Additionally, a s part of the process of the Design for Environment, t he C ompany e mphasize s resource conservation , and aim s to reduce environmental impact by reducing resource consumption and minimizing waste during product use . Pollution prevention and reduction Seiko Epson has a zero emission s program for reducing the amount of waste materials produced by business activities and recycling these materials. All waste materials generated by manufacturing activities and offices are reduced, reused, recycled within business sites , and then sent to processing companies for recycl ing . In addition, Seiko Epson is working actively to improve the recycling rate of factory wastewater, and to respon d to tightened water quality regulations . Sustainable water resources and wastewater management Seiko Epson recognizes that water resources has a significant influence on the ir business activities as these activities highly rely on water resources. Under this recognition, the C ompany has a fundamental policy of protecting water resources by avoiding polluti on and not consuming water more than necessary during its production processes and recycling used water. In addition, while conducting water risk assessments of production sit es using the assessment tools of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF ), the C ompany identifies high - risk sites and conducts water resources conservation at those sites . 8 Renewable energy Seiko Epson has set the goal of reducing GHG emissions from business activities (scopes 1 and 2) by 19% from FY2017 to FY2025. This target has been approved by the SBTi. 9 To achieve this goal, Seiko Epson has been introducing the use of renewable energy at business sites. The use of rene wable energy increased significantly from 0.8% in FY2017 to 11.6% in FY2018 because of long - term sourcing contracts for hydroelectric and other renewable energy and the on - site generation of electricity at business sites outside Japan. Based on the above , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Seiko Epson is well positioned to issue green bonds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the use of the proceeds outlined in the framework will contribute to the achievement of the environmental goals, policies and programs of Seiko Epson. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the green projects that Seiko Epson will fund from the proceeds will produce environm ental benefits , they have potential risk involving the environment and society. The potential risks include noise, vibrations, soil contamination, water pollution, and a negative impact on the safety and health of workers and the ecological system. Moreover, the recycling of waste materials and manufacture of products may pollute the environment and cause bodily harm by increasing the overall environmental impact across the entire life cycle of products or by improperly handling hazardous substances. Seiko Epson mitigate s these risk factors by applying the following policies and processes. ▪ Seiko Epson operates an environmental management system that utilizes ISO14001 international standard for the management of environmental risk, identifies and eval uates potential environmental risk factors, such as a process that does not comply with a numerical environmental standard. The Epson Group has also unified standards across the group for the prevention of environmental pollution to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. For the management of chemicals, a data management system is used for the centralized handling of this information worldwide. The C ompany continuously implements measures for the reduction of the usage of chemicals and lowering emissi ons of PRTR (pollutant release and transfer register) substances 10 and volatile organic compounds (VOC). 11 To ensure that suppliers do not violate regulations concerning chemicals contained in products , Seiko Epson 7 Seiko Epson, “SBTi Approves Eps on's GHG Reduction Targets”, at: https://global.epson.com/newsroom/2018/news_20181130.html 8 Seiko Epson, “Preservation of Water Resources”, at: https://global.epson.com/SR/environment/resources/water.html 9 Seiko Epson, “SBTi Approves Epson's GHG Reduction Targets”, at: https://global.epson.com/newsroom/2018/news_20181130.html 10 Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, “PRTR System (Japanese only)”, at: https://www.meti.go.jp/policy/chemical_management/law/prtr/index.html 11 Seiko Epson, “Production”, at: https://global.epson.com/SR/environment/pollution/production.html,Second - Party Opinion Seiko Epson Corporation Green Bond Framework 7 asks all suppliers to follow the guidelines in the Epson Group Green Purchasing Standards 12 for Production Materials. ▪ Seiko Epson established its own system, called the ”New Epson Safety & Health Program (NESP)”, 13 which is based on the occupational safety and health management systems (OSHMS) guidelines, and performs a risk assessment involving riskiness and hazardousness. A PDCA cycle is used to monitor performance and continuously improve the safety and health en vironment. ▪ Seiko Epson places “S trengthening of supply chain management ” as one of the C ompany’s materiality themes, and perform periodic assessments and improvement support of all types of risk, safety management and other items to reduce the risks. 14 In addition, the C ompany established the “ Epson Group Procurement Guidelines ” , 15 which comply with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct and include requirements concerning labor, the environment, ethics, and safety and health and ask the sup pliers to comply with it. Regarding procurement of minerals, Seiko Epson uses tools provided by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) to examine supply chains as a member of the RMI. 16 Seiko Epson has established goals to be achieved by 2020 , “ All criti cal suppliers earn no less than a medium - risk rank ” and “ Ensure that minerals are sourced only from smelters certified by the RMI’s Conflict - Free Smelter (CFS) Program ” . Based on the above, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Seiko Epson is well positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks associated with the green projects. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds The four use of proceeds categories described in the Framework are recognized as impactful by the GBP and Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2017 . Sustainalytics explains the environmental impact o f the following two use of proceeds categories relevant to Seiko Epson . Importance of improving energy efficiency of printers and multifunction printers According to a study by the International Energy Agency (IEA) , improvement in energy efficiency is expected to make the largest contribut ion , approximately 48% on a policy b asis , to global GHG emissions reductions towards 2030. 17 In its intended nationally determined contribution (INDC), Japan has committed to cut its GHG emissions to 26% below the FY2013 level by FY2030. To reach this goal, Japan has set the target of cutting its final energy consumption by about 50.3 million kiloliters (crude oil equivalent) during this period which is equivalent to a 35% improvement in energy consumption efficiency. 18 Japan has adopted the T op R unner Program 19 in order to improve the en ergy efficiency of power - consum ing equipment and has set a time - bound target standard value for applicable product s . Printers and multifunction printers were added to the coverage of the program in 2013 and the energy consumption efficiency of the industry has been improved. 20 However , since electricity consumption by office equipment and lights has been increasing , 21 and printing devices such as printers and multifunction printers account for abou t 10% of total electricity consumption in office s , 22 further reductions in the energy consumption of these devices are nee ded. Seiko Epson plans to allocate the proceeds to manufacturing and R&D expenditures for printers and multifunction printers that improve energy efficiency compared with products from other companies with equivalent specifications .

Therefore , it is a printing method that reduces electricity consumption during the printing process in compared to laser printing method . Seiko Epson estimates that its business inkjet printers contributed to reduc ing the environmental impact by 8,909 t - CO2e in FY2 018. 23 Sustainalytics believes that this use of proceeds will contribute to climate change measures by reduc ing GHG emissions as a result of reducing energy consumption through the use of the C ompany’s printers and multifunction printers at residents , office s , and within the commercial and industrial sector . Environmental benefits of efficient resource use due to recycling and reuse The volume of w aste electrical and electronic equipment ( E - waste) including printers and personal computers, has been increasing worldwide, and is pr edicted to increase from 44.7 million tons in 2016 to 52.2 million tons in 2021 . Only 20% of this waste was collected and recycled in 2016 and the remainder was incin erated and landfilled. 24 For consumables such as ink cartridges , the recycling rate is about 30%. 25 Because E - waste and consumables contain metals, rare earth metal s, plastic and other materials, the improper disposal of these products will cause environmen tal and health damage due to air, water and soil contamination, and require effective use of resources through recycling . For waste paper, the global total reuse rate is approximately 60%, and Japan is approximately 65%. 26 The use of waste paper not only reduces waste but also leads to the sustainable use of forest resources and the reduction of water and energy consumption , and therefore, it is aimed at further improving the utilization rate. Seiko Epson conducts a collection and recycling program f or its end - of - life products such as printers, projectors , and PCs as well as cartridges around the world , and has collected , in the aggregate, 220,000 tons of used products and 52,000 tons of cartridges i n FY2018. Seiko Epson conducts R&D of and manufactures its dry process office papermaking system that make s new paper from used paper at an office or other location and has contributed to the acceleration of the use of used paper at office s which introduce the product. Based on the above, Sus tainalytics is of the opinion that the collection and recycling program of Seiko Epson products and consumables a s well as the manufacturing and R&D of dry process papermaking system s ha ve clear environmental benefits while contributing to the efficient us e of resources, reduction of the waste material volumes, and prevention of harm to the environment and health. Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. This green bond advances the following SDG goals and targets: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Eco - effi cient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes 9.

Affordable and Clean Energy 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix Conclusion Seiko Epson intends to issue green bonds under the Framework and use the proceeds to finance and/or refinance the eligible green projects in four eligible categories: 1) Eco - efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes , 2) P ollution prevention and control; 3) S ustainable water and wastewater management; and 4) R enewable energy. Seiko Epson commits to contributing to the creation of a sustainable society by achieving the goals of its Environmental Vision 2050, a long - term vision, and the targets of Epson 25, a medium - term g oal. Sustainalytics believes that the use of proceeds explained in the F ramework will contribute to achieving Seiko Epson’s sustainability targets as well as to advance the UN Sustainable Development Goal s 6, 7 ,9 and 12. Seiko Epson’s use of the proceeds is recognized by the GBP and Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2017 as project categories with clear environmental impact. The project evaluation and selection process and process for the management of the proceeds, as defined in the F ramework, are aligned with market practice. Furthermore, t he project evaluation and selection and the management of proceeds outlined in the F ramework is in line with market practice , and the annual allocation and impact reporting along with its commitment to obtain ing a compliance review is in line with market best practice . Based on the above, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Seiko Epson Green Bond Framework is credible, impactful and aligned with the four core components of the GBP 2018 and Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2017 .,Second - Party Opinion Seiko Epson Corporation Green Bond Framework 10 Appendices Appendix 1: Framework Overview For the purpose of issuing green bonds, Seiko Epson has developed the following framework which addresses the four key core components of the GBP: use of proceeds, project evaluation and selection process, management of proceeds, and reporting, i n November 2019 .

Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objec tives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification agains t a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustaina ble features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of enviro nmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria.,Second - Party Opinion Seiko Epson Corporation Green Bond Framework 18 iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Gre en Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The outpu t may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environm ental risks.,Second - Party Opinion Seiko Epson Corporation Green Bond Framework 19 Disclaimer © Sustainalytics 2019.
