The C ompany , part of Tritax Group (the " Group " ) , 1 focuses on servicing occupiers, including retailers, manufacturers and third - party logistics operators , around major population centres . The Company itself has no employees, and it has appointed Tritax Managemen t LLP (the " Manager " ) as an external manager with oversight by the Board of Tritax EuroBox plc (the " Board " ) . Tritax EuroBox has developed the Tritax EuroBox Gre e n Finance Framework (the " F ramework " ) under which it intends to issue green bond s and loans to use the proceeds to finance and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and/ or future eligible green projects that advance sustainable buildings and logistics solutions that reduce the carbon fo otprint of its operations . The F ramework defines eligibil ity criteria in three areas : 1. Green Buildings 2. Renewable Energy 3. Energy Efficiency Tritax EuroBox engaged Sustainalytics to review the Tritax EuroBox Gr e en Finance Framework , dated April 2021 , and provide a S econd - P arty O pinion on the F ramework ' s environmenta l credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) 2 and the Green Loan Principles 2021 (GLP) . 3 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 4 Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ' Second - Party Opinion Sustain alytics ' Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ' independent 5 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible project categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Seco nd - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • T he Framew ork ' s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA , and the Green Loan Principles 202 1 , as administered by LMA, APLMA and LSTA; 6 • The credibility and anticipated po sitive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and • The alignment of the is suer ' s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its interna l taxonomy, version 1.7 , which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ' expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Tritax EuroBox ' s management team to understand th e sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Tritax EuroBox representatives have confirmed (1) they understand i t is the sole responsibility of Tr itax EuroBox to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been dul y disclosed in a timely manner. Su stainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics ' opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. Any update of the pres ent Second - Party Opinion will be c onducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and Tritax EuroBox . 1 Tritax Group is comprised of Tr itax Management LLP, Tritax Big Box REIT plc, Tritax EuroBox plc, Tritax Property Income Fund and Tritax MetroBox. 2 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://ww w.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ . 3 The Green Loan Principles are administered by the Loan Market Association, Asia Pa cific Loan Market Association and Loan Syndications & Trading Association and are availab le at https://www.lsta.org/content/green - loan - principles/ 4 The Tritax EuroBox Green Finance Frame work is available on Tritax EuroBox’s website at: https://www.tritaxeurobox.co.uk/news/ . 5 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a corner stone of Sustainalytics and ensuring analyst independence is paramount to producing objec tive, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust conflict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independen ce, consistency of process, structural separation of commercial and research (and engagem ent) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to spec ific commercial outcomes. One of Sustainal ytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparency. 6 In addition to the Loan Markets Association, the GLP is also administered by the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association and the Loan Syndications & Trading Association.,Second - Party Opinion Tritax EuroBox Gre e n Finance Framework 3 Sustainalytics ' Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market standards, is no guaran tee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics ' Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The mea surement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the potential allocation of proceed s but does not guarantee the reali sed allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or argumen t , either in favour or against, th e truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that Tritax EuroBox has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second - Party Opinion . Sustainalytics ' Opinion Section 1: Sustainal ytics ' Opinion on the Tritax EuroBox Gre e n Finance Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Tritax EuroBox G r e en Finance Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns to the four core components of the GBP and GLP . Sustainalytics highlights t he following elements of Tritax EuroBo x ' s G reen Finance F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible categor ies – Green Buildings , Renewable Energy , and Energy Efficiency – are aligned with those recognized by the GBP and GLP . - For the " Green Buildings " categ ory, the Company intends to utilize bond and loan proceeds for the development or acquisition of properties that meet at least o ne of the following: m inimum BREEAM (in Use and Construction) “ Very Good ” , DGNB “ Gold “ or equivalent ; having an internationally and/or nationally recognized certification that fall s within the top 15% of existing national stock such as the equivalent Energy Performance Certificate ( EPC ) for each jurisdiction ; or having an embodied carbon intensity of 300kg CO 2 e/m 2 or lower. With re gards to these criteria, Sustainalytics notes the fol lowing: ▪ Sustainalytics recognizes BREEAM and DGNB scheme s as credible, and the levels selected to be aligned with market expectation. Sustainalytics recognizes that for certain classes of developments, B REEAM Excellent may be viewed as best practice. Susta inalytics considers the use of BREEAM Very Good to be aligned with market expectations for logistics and warehousing real estate, and in any case encourages the selection of BREEAM buildings that achieve a minimum score of 70% in the Energy category. See Appendix 1 for a further description of this building scheme. ▪ Sustainalytics considers that focusing on buildings that fall in the top 15% within each jurisdiction to be aligned with market practice and n otes EPC ratings as a credible mech anism to evaluate energy efficiency. ▪ Sustainalytics recognizes the importance of embodied carbon when assessing the lifecycle impact of buildings, noting that embodied carbon emissions accounted for 11 % of total annual bu ilt environmental emissions in 201 9 7 and views favorably the Company ' s ambition to account for this factor. Embodied carbon continues to be an emerging area of inquiry within the sustainable finance space, and at this time Sustainalytics does not consider there to be a recognized baseline or accepted level of best practice. 8 Nevertheless, Sustainalytics notes that the threshold of 300kg CO 2 e/m 2 specified within the Framework (i) is in line with international proposals, 9 and (ii) has 7 UNEP, “ 2019 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction Sector”, (2019), at: https://www.unep.org/resources/publication/2019 - gl obal - status - report - buildings - and - construction - sector . 8 Neither the EU Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance nor the Climate Bonds Initiative have included embodied carbon within their approach to evaluating green buildings. 9 For example, that of the Sweden Green Building Council’s NollCO 2 standard. NollCO 2 requires construction materials to have a maximum embed ded carbon of 240kg/m 2 floor areas and construction processes to contribute no more than 60 kg/m 2 .,Second - Party Opinion Tritax EuroBox Gre e n Finance Framework 4 been disclosed by the Gr oup to represent a significant improvement 10 on current standard construction practices. In this context, the Framework ' s commitments regarding embodied carbon are viewed positively, and Sustainalytics highlights that the Company has disclosed that it will us e accepted methodologies in measuring embodied carbon. 11 Sustainalytics also notes that the issuer intends to continue pursuing green building certification where relevant, which will account for emissions over the building ' s operational phase. ▪ Sustainaly t ics views the selection of buildings within the top 15% of their local market in terms of energy efficiency to be in line with market practice, and highlights that the Company will rely on accepted national or international certifications to support this a ssessment. - Within the " Renewable Energy " category, Tritax EuroBox intends to finance investments and/or expenditures for the acquisition, development, construction and/or installation of on - and off - site renewable energy projects. Eligible projects includ e solar, wind, biogas, and geothermal projects with life - cycle emission s lower than 100gCO 2 /kWh. Sustainalytics considers this threshold to be in line with market practice, and further notes that biogas feedstock will be sourced from biomass and industrial waste . The Company has confirmed to Sustainalytics that the feedstock will primarily involve food waste, and exclude waste stemming from oil and gas operations. This is in line with market practice. - The " Energy Efficiency " cate gory includes expenditures for refurbishment and/or renovations that result in a minimum 30% improvement in energy efficiency or a two - letter grade improvement in EPC labels; as well as investments in specific equipment, such as energy storage technology and ground source heat pumps with low - GWP refrigerants . Sustainalytics notes that heat pumps offer an energy - efficient heat transfer alternative to conventional systems , and encourages Tritax EuroBox to promote robust refrigerant leak control, detection and monitoring, while ensuring recovery, reclamation/recycling, or destruction of refrigerant at end of life. Sustainalytics considers investments that deliver the aforementioned levels of improvem ent, as well as the individual measures specified, to be in line with market practice. • P roject Evaluation and Selection: - The Manager has created the Green Finance Committee ( " GFC " ) , as a sub - committee of its CSR Committee, to be in charge of project eval uation and selection and ensure that selected assets or projects comply with the Framewor k ' s eligibility criteria. The GFC is comprised of the Sustainability Lead, the CFO, and a member of the Asset Management tea m of the Manager . The GFC will regularly monitor the Green Portfolio of the Company to confirm Eligible Green Projects ( " EGPs " ) rema in compliant. The Manager is ultimately responsible for the final decision on approving investments. - Based on the establishment of the GFC and its co mmitment to ongoing review of project c ompliance , Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - The Company will manage net proceeds of any Green Finance Transaction ( " GFT " ) on a portfolio basis, and it w ill ensure EGPs ’ value exceed the amount of any GFT. The Treasury function of the Manager will be in charge of managing net proceeds, and a list of EGPs will be maintained by the Finance team. - The Green Portfolio may include investments in projects or assets up until 36 months preceding the relevant GFT. Tritax EuroBox intends to fully allocate net proceeds as soon as practicable and no later than 18 months following issuance. Pending allocation, net proceeds will be managed by the Company ' s Finance fun ction and unallocated proceeds will be temporarily invested in cash , cash equivalents and/or liquid marketable liquidity instruments, in compliance with the Company ' s Finance policy, and/or used for the temporary repayment of debt under the existing revolv ing credit facilities . - In case the Company disposes of buildings financed by the GFT, or any EGPs are no longer eligible, the Company will substitute such projects or assets as soon as is practicable. 10 The Group has co mmissioned a study to evaluate the anticipated carbon savings that it can anticipate, this third - party report estimates that feasible impro vements to the design and construction could result in a 9% savings in lifecycle building carbon emissions and a 12.5 % savings in the construction phase. The report also identified future options for consideration which would result in even greater impacts . 11 Namely the European Carbon Assessment Standard - EN 15978: 2011, which is aligned with ISO Standard 14044 and rec ognized by BREEAM as a credible methodology.,Second - Party Opinion Tritax EuroBox Gre e n Finance Framework 5 - Based on the establishment of a portfolio and the handl ing of unallocated net proceeds, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Repo rting: - The Company intends to publish an Annual Green Finance Report, detailing the allocation of net proceeds of the GFTs and the associated imp act metrics until the full allocation of net proceeds. - Allocation reporting will include the amount raised and outstanding from each GFT and amounts allocated to date for each instrument; the percentage split of net proceeds used for financing versus refin ancing; the total amount in the Green Portfolio, along with a breakdown by project category; the remaining bala nce of unallocated proceeds ; and project and asset descriptions per each project category. - The impact reporting will include impact metrics such as, but not limited to, building certification (scheme and rating); energy consumption (kWh); on - site renewable electricity generated (kWh); energy consumption (kWh) , and annual GHG emissions reduced/avoided (kg CO2 eq pa) . - Based on the Group ' s allocation and impact reporting commitments, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. Ali gnment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 and Green Loan Principles 2020 Sustainalytics has determined that the Tritax EuroBox Gr e en Finance Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP and GLP . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 2 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Susta inability Strategy of Tritax EuroBox Contribution of framework to Tritax EuroBox ' s sustainability strategy Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Tritax EuroBox demonstrates a commitment to sustainability , in line with their sustainability vision to " demonstrate leadership in sustainable logistics, working in collaboration with stakeholders, to create a positive change and value in the long term " 13 by (i) ensuring and demonstrating sustainability credentials of assets, (ii) achieving net zero carbon across all direct activities, (iii) enhancing well - being and nature on land and for stakeholders , and (iv ) creating and demonstrating social value in investments. 12 T he Company has developed an overall sustainability goal to create positive environmental and socio - economic impact by 2030 13 and to achieve these key strategy priorities, Tritax EuroBox has defined a series of goals targets to be achieved by 2023 , includ ing : ▪ Demonstrat e h ealthy and sustainable buildings – to ensure all assets align w ith the Company’s ESG investment principles . T he C ompany aims to improve EPC labels, improv e GRESB scores to three Green S tars, includ e green leases on all new leases and to obtain green building certifications, namely BREEAM. ▪ Net zero carbon – Tritax aims to achieve net zero carbon emission in direct operations for scope 1 and 2 GHG emission s , installing renewable energy generation projects where feasible , and increasing energy efficiency of operations by ensur ing all assets have LED lighting an d building management systems to monitor and improve performance. ▪ Improve biodiversity and well - being – the Company plans on implementing biodiversity, climate and well - being measures across all asset s and installing electric vehicle charging stations and cycle facilities. ▪ Drive social value through investment – to create positive socio - economic impact through investments by measuring social value to demonstrate the impa ct of its investments; supportin g local community causes with tenants ; and supporting employment and skills initiatives for assets with the highest levels of deprivation. Tritax Eurobox has reported progress towards these goals , including 40% of the Compa ny ' s portfolio being certified w ith green building certifications, including BREEAM Very Good and DGNB Gold. 13 75% of the Compan y’s floor area has achieved EPC labels . The Tritax EuroBox portfolio achieved an im proved GRESB 14 ESG Rating, achieving 64/100, up from 53 in 2019. 13 The Company generated 2,259 MWh of on - site renewable energy in 2019 and is aiming to switch to 100% renewable energy for its electricity use in e arly 2021. 13 12 Tritax EuroBox Annual Report 2020, at: Tritax - EuroBox - plc - Annual - Report - 2020.pdf 13 Tritax Eu roBox Plc EPRA 2019 Sustainability Best Practice Indicators, at: PowerPoint Presentation (tritaxeurobox.co.uk) 14 Global Real Estate Sus tainability Benchmark, “what we do”, at: About GRESB and ESG benchmarking,Second - Party Opinion Tritax EuroBox Gre e n Finance Framework 6 The Group’s CSR committee is responsible for its ESG strategy and Environmental Policy . 15 The CSR Committe e has four sub - committees focused on governance, property, charity and social activities . 12 Sustainability Risks Assessments are undertaken upon acquisition of asset s , which are used as a baseline for the development of a Sustainability Action Plan for each asset to improve sustainability performance b oth from a management and operational perspective. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Tritax EuroBox Gre e n Finance Framework is aligned with the company ' s overall sust ainability strategy and initiatives and will further the Company ' s action on its key environmental priorities. Well - positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the net proce eds from the bond s issued under the Framework will be directed towards eligible p rojects that are expected to have positive environmental impact, Sustainalytics is aware that such eligible projects could also lead to negative environmental and social outco mes . Some key environmental and social risks associated with the eligible project s, could include occupational health and safety, land - use change, biodiversity loss, and impacts on local communities. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Tritax is able to manage and/or mitigate potential risks through implementation of the following: • The Company performs Sustainability Risk Assessments on the acquisi tion of assets , and social and environmental impact assessments are carried out for all assets. 13 This information further supports the elabora tion of Sustainability Action Plans ( " SAPs " ), which are set to improve the sustainability performance of each asset and address identified risks. Along with site inspections, SAPs are updated every year to reassess or identify new risks. 12 • The Company has incorporated ESG considerations as an integral component of its Investment Policy. To this end, the Group performs ESG assessments on acquisitions and is aiming for all new developments to be carbon neutral. 12 • As part of its commitment to maintaining a high ethical standard , the Group continually monitors risks associated with modern slavery and assesses the Group ' s suppliers and their ef forts to address it along thei r supply chains. 16 • The Manager is accredited to the ISO 14001 certification standard for environmental management system. 12 Through the CSR Committee, the Group monitors environmental and social risks, trends and opportunities affecting the business . The Committee is responsible for regularly identif ying the significant environmental impacts; monitor ing and measur ing ESG issues and impacts. 17 • T he Group has a number of policies relat ed to ESG matters, including the Environmental, Social and Governance Policy 18 , Tritax Health and Safety Policy 19 , Tritax Environmental Policy Statement, 20 Materiality Assessment to Identify Su stainability Priorities 21 and Tritax Business Code of Conduct . 22 These policies cover identification, management and mitigation of ESG objectives, health and safety at work and with suppliers and local community stakeholder engagement . Based on these poli cies, standards and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Tritax has implemented adequat e measures and is well - positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible categories. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All three use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP and GLP . Sustainalytics has focused on the below where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context. 15 Tritax EuroBox, “Environmental Policy”, (2019), at: SMid Ptr19062810500 (tritaxeurobox.co.uk) 16 Tritax Eurobox, “Modern Slavery Act 2015: Slavery and human trafficking statement”, (2020) at: EuroBox - Modern - Slavery - Statement - 2020 - final.pdf (tritax eurobox.co.uk) 17 Tritax Management LLP, “CSR Committee Terms of Reference”, (2019) at: Corporate - Social - Responsibil ity - Committee - Terms - of - Reference.pdf (tritaxeurobox.co.uk) 18 Tritax Group, “Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Policy”,(2021) at: tritax - group - esg - policy - march - 2021.pdf 19 Tritax Management LLP, “Health and Safety Policy”, (2020, at: tritax - management - llp - health - and - safety - policy - october - 2020.pdf 20 Tritax Group, “Environmental Policy Statement”, (2020), at: environmental - policy - 2020.pdf (tritax.co.uk) 21 Tritax Group, Materiality Assessment to Identify Sustainability Priorities, (2020) at: tri tax - group - materality - assessment - 2020.pdf 22 Tritax Management LLP, “Business Code of Conduct”, (2021) at: tritax - business - code - of - conduct - march - 2021 - docx.pdf,Second - Party Opinion Tritax EuroBox Gre e n Finance Framework 7 Importance of green buildings in Ge rmany, the Netherlands and Spain The building sector contributes towards 40% of the total energy consumpt ion and 36% of CO 2 emissions in the Eur opean Union ( " EU " ). 23 The European Commission reports that while 75% of the EU building stock is considered energy inefficient, only 1% of buildings under g o energy efficien cy renovations each year. 24 Acceleration of renovati on activities could reduce both the EU ’s total energy consumption and carbon emissions by 5%. 24 In order for the EU to meet its carbon neutral goal by 2050, it needs to i mprov e the energy efficiency of it s building stock in combination with the construction of new energy efficient buildings . In Germany , buildings are responsible for 35% of the country ' s final energy consumption. 25 As the most populous country within Europe, Germany plays a key role in drivin g the EU ' s cli mate targets. Although the renovation rate is higher in Germany than the European average, only 1.5% of its building stock undergoes renovation annually. 26 Germany has set a target for its building stock to be climate neutral by 205 0 , 27 and as part of this goal, Germany aims to reduce building sector emissio ns by 67% by 2030 compared to a 1990 baseline. 27 In order to achieve these goals, significant investment is required into energy efficiency and re newable energy within green buildings. In the Netherlands, the Dutch government has implemente d legislation towards making real estate more energy - efficient and has established a national goal of improving EPC labels to a level " C " or higher by 2023 and a decree that requires all office buildings to have a n EPC A by 2030. 28 Additionally, after 202 0 newly built houses must reach the nearly zero energy building (NZEB) 29 standard, a requirement by the EPBD from 2021. 30 In 2021, Spain does not yet have any offic ial legislation supporting NZEB . 29 A pproximately 84% of the Spanish building stock is energy inefficient , 31 posing a relatively greater challenge in Spain in contribu ting towards EU climate goals. Additionally, 55% of buildings were built pri or to 1980 , and 21% are more than 50 years old . 31 The renovation of existing building stock is vital for European nations in achieving energy sa v ings and emissions reductions. In th is context , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Tritax EuroBox ’s investments in green buildings and energy efficiency will contribute towards lowering GHG emissions in the building sector. Alignment with/ contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 by the United Nations Gene ral Assembly and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. The bonds issued under the Tritax EuroBox Gr e en Finance Framework advances the following SDG s and tar get s : Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Green Buildings 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure 9.4 By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource - use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities.

Sustainalytics considers that the projects f unded by the green bond and loan proceeds are expected to have a positive environmental imp act. The Tritax EuroBox Gr e en Finance Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for rep orting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics bel ieves that the Tritax EuroBox Gr e en Finance Framework is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use of proceeds categorie s will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 9. Addit ionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Tritax EuroBox has adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associat ed with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Tritax EuroBox is well - positioned to issue green bonds and loans and that the Tritax EuroBox Gr e en Finance Framework is robust, transparent, a nd in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bo nd Principles 2018 and Green Loan Principles 202 1 .,Second - Party Opinion Tritax EuroBox Gre e n Finance Framework 9 Append i ces Appendix 1: Sustainalytics Assessment of Green Building Certification Schemes DGNB 32 BREEAM 33 Background DGNB was developed in 200 7 by the non - profit German Sustainable Building Council in partnership with the German Federal Ministry of Transport, Building, and Urban Affairs in order to actively encourage sustainable building. BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental As sessment Method) was first published by the Buil ding Research Establishment (BRE) in 1990. Based in the UK. Used for new, refurbished and extension of existing buildings. Certification levels • Bronze • Silver • Gold • Platinum • Pass • Good • Very Good • Excellent • Outstanding Areas of Assessment: • Environment • Economic • Sociocultural and functional aspects • Technology • Processes & Site • Management • Energy • Land Use and Ecology • Pollution • Transport • Materials • Water • Waste • Health and Wellbeing Innovation Requirements P ercentage - based performance index. The total performance index (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by adding the six key areas of assessment. Depending on the total performance index, a DGNB award will be given to the project, starting from Silv e r. Bronze is awarded for existing buildings and is conferred as the lowest rank. Prerequisites depending on the levels of certification and credits with associated points This number of points is then weighted by item and gives a BREEAM level of cert i fication, which is based on the overall score obtained (expressed as a percentage). Majority of BREEAM issues are flexible, meaning that the client can choose which to comply with to build their BREEAM performance score. BREAAM has two stages/ audit rep o rts: a ‘BREEAM Design Stage’ and a ‘Post Construction Stage’, with different assessment criteria. Performance display Qualitative Considerations DGNB certification is based on current European Union standards. Used in more than 70 countries: Goo d adaptation to the local normative context.

Second - Party Opinion: A n institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second - Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer ' s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information b arriers, will have been implemented within the insti tution to ensure the independence of the Second - Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer ' s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or pr ocesses relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, t ypically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the envir onmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer ' s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of re porting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines spec ific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issu er can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond fr amework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating met hodology. The output may include a focus on environm ental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflec t material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion Tritax EuroBox Gre e n Finance Framework 15 Disclaimer Copyright ©202 1 Sustainalytics.
