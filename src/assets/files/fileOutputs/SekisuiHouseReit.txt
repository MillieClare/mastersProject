(“SHR”) has developed the SHR Green Bond Framework (the “framework”) under which it is planning to issue multiple green bonds and use the proceeds for the acquisition of new and/or existing green buildings and/or toward refinancing the existing loan /investment corporation bonds that ha s already been allocated to green buildings. SHR engaged Sustainalytics to review the SHR Green Bond Framework and provide a second - party opinion on the alignment of the green bond with the Green Bond Principles 2018 (the “GBP”), as administered by the International Capital Market Association (the “ICMA”), 1 and on the framewo rk’s environmental credentials. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of SHR 's asset manager, Sekisui House Asset Management Ltd. (“SHAM”) including Finance Department and Business Strategy Department , which is a department dedicated to ESG promotion to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of SHR ’s green bond s . Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains two sections : Framework Overview – summary of the SHR Green Bond Framework ; and Sustainalytics ’ Opinion – an opinion on the Framework . Overview of Issuer SHR is a Japan - based com pany that operates as a real estate investment trust having residential properties and office buildings as its core assets . The asset manager of the company , SHAM , is a sub sidiary of Sekisui House, Ltd . (“Sekisui House”) , one of the leading homebuilders in Japan . Sekisui House made a “Declaration of Sustainability” positioning sustainability as a management criterion in 2005. Later, Sekisui House announced the “ Sustainable Vision ” and the Eco - First Promise and has been promoting sustainable management which is a pi oneering idea in Japan at the time. As one of the leading homebuilders in Japan, Sekisui House is actively promoting the initiatives to the SDGs, which are considered as a common goal for the international community, especially aiming to contribute to the achievement of national objectives for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector. SHAM invests on SHR ’s philosophy of “ provision of high quality social capital” and “maximization of unitholder value” along with the “Sustainable Vi sion” and initiatives oriented toward “the realization of a sustainable society” shared with Sekisui House. 2 SHR is planning to issue green bond s aiming further promotion of real estate investment manag ement with considerations given to environmental, social and governance (ESG) based on its Sustainability Policy . 1 ICMA’s Green Bond Principles 2018: https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ 2 Sekisui House Sustainability Report 2018: https://www.sekisuihouse.co.jp/english/sr/datail/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2018/07/25/all - A4.pdf,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sekisui House Reit Green Bond 3 Framework Overview For the purpose of issuing green bonds, SHR has d eveloped the following framework which addresses the four core components of GBP: use of proceeds, project evaluation and selection process, management of proceeds, and reporting. The framework belongs to SHR , and a summary overview has been provided below . Use of Proceeds The proceeds of the green bond will be allocated to acquire the new and/or existing buildings that meet the following eligibility criteria (‘Eligible Green Projects’) and/or to refinance the existing loan/investment corporati on bonds which have been allocated to Eligible Green Projects . Eligibility Criteria 1. Green Buildings To be eligible for green bond proceeds, an Eligible Green Project must meet the following eligibility criteria: • Buildings that have a valid third - party certification described below on the date of the green bond issuance and/ or that are expected to receive the certification post issuance. At the time of reporting, build ing s which meet the same criteria as of the end of March of each year: - 3 , 4 , or 5 S tars under the DBJ Green Building Certification , or - A or S rank under the Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE) certification for real es tate . The current validity periods of the third - party certifications are two or three years for DBJ Green Building Certifications and five years for CASBEE certifications for real estate from the date of receiving respective certifications. These validity periods, however, may change when SHR obtains certification s or recertification s in the future. Project Evaluation and Selection Process Application of Eligibility Criteria in Project Selection Eligible Green Projects will be evaluated and selected by a Sustainability Committee, which is chaired by the president and representative director and includes all full - time directors of SHAM, in accordance with SHR and SHAM ’s Sustainability Policy and th e E ligibility C riteria . Sustainability Objectives SHR and SHAM ha ve established a Sustainability Policy, which is adhered to and put into practice throughout its business activities. SHAM ’ s Sustainability Committee, meanwhile, sets targets, verifies compliance therewith, quantifies the effects of the measures taken, and d evises improvement actions, on a periodic basis. SHAM has also created a department dedicated to ESG promotion in order to enhance its ESG initiatives. Sustainability Policy SHR and SHAM ’s Sustainability Policy states the following: • We implement in - house training for the purpose of enhancing knowledge with regard to ESG - related laws, regulations and rules, and abide by such laws, regulations and rules in conducting real estate investment management with considerations given to ESG. • To plan for the achievement of a low - carbon society and actively promote the efficient use of energy, we have set reduction targets for energy use at the properties held by SHR in accordance with laws and regulations and shall follow a plan - do - check - act (PDCA) cycle to a chieve the targets. • We shall actively contribute to the creation of a recycling - based society by promoting measures and public awareness activities for reducing water use and implementing the three Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle) in relation to resources. • I n accordance with the "Gohon no ki" (Five Trees) Planning promoted by Sekisui House, we conduct maintenance and management of planting and other greenery measures, centering on tree species with,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sekisui House Reit Green Bond 4 consideration given to the native vegetation and other ecosys tem matters. By doing so, we aim to realize harmony with the nature and the surrounding environment. • We shall provide high quality homes where residents of residential properties can lead their lives in comfort, and convenient, safe and comfortable spaces that contribute to enhancing the productivity of tenant companies in commercial properties. We will also promote the installation of facilities to ensure that residents can live safely and securely in the event of a disaster and the provision of “sustaina ble bases of operation” to tenant companies with considerations given to their business continuity plans (BCPs). • We create activity and prosperity by cooperating with local events and through other means, in an effort to find common interests with the regi ons and communities as well as to invigorate them. • To implement initiatives based on this policy, we shall strive to cooperate with property management companies and other partners, residents of residential properties, tenant companies and facility users o f commercial properties, and other stakeholders. • We adopt the perspectives of green procurement and corporate social responsibilities in our investment and management operations in order to promote ESG awareness through our supply chains. • While regularly monitoring our action measures, etc. regarding ESG, we disclose information concerning sustainability performance on our website and through other media. In addition, we will continue our efforts to acquire environmental certification and recogni tion from outside assessment agencies. Process to Mitigate Environmental and Social Risks To address environmental and social risks, the Sustainability Committee plans to identify and manage significant potential environmental and social risks inherent in Eligible Green Projects, as well as reviewing data pertaining to environmental and social issues. Management of Proceeds SHR plans to allocate the net proceeds of the green bonds to Eligible Green Projects. As long as the green bonds are outstanding, SHR will conduct management to ensure that the total amount of the outstanding green bonds does not exceed the total acquisition price of the Eligible Green Projects. A s long as the green bonds are outstanding, SHR will internally track and m anage the allocated proceeds on a portfolio basis. If the total or part of the proceeds of the green bonds are not immediately allocated to Eligible Green Projects, SHR will specify the unallocated proceeds and, pending their allocation to Eligible Green P rojects, maintain total or part of the unallocated proceeds in cash or cash equivalents. Reporting Allocation Reporting SHR will disclose on its website that the net proceeds of the green bonds are fully allocated to Eligible Green Projects in accordan ce with its Green Bond Framework, and that the total amount of the outstanding green bonds does not exceed the total acquisition price of Eligible Green Projects. While the green bonds are outstanding, SHR will annually report the total acquisition price o f Eligible Green Projects and the total amount of the outstanding green bonds, as of the end of March. It may also receive assertions by SHAM's president and representative director that the net proceeds have been alloca ted to Eligible Green Projects.,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sekisui House Reit Green Bond 5 Impact Reporting SHR will disclose the following quantitative en vironmental performance indicators annually on its website , as of the end of March, as long as the green bonds are outstanding: • The number of the buildings of Eligible Green Projects • The levels of certifications acquired by respective Eligible Green Projects • The total floor area of Eligible Green Projects • The following quantitative indicators of Eligible Green Projects (where SHR has energy control authority) - Electricity consu mption - Water consumption - CO 2 emissions,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sekisui House Reit Green Bond 6 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the SHR Green Bond Framework Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the SHR Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 201 8 .

According to its 2017 Annual Rep ort , Sekisui House is aiming to reduce CO 2 emissions by approximately 40% by 2030 below the 2013 level , 13 which Sustainalytics highlights is above national INDC commitments. Sustainalytics believes that SHR ’s green bond s will play a key role in financing green buildings and creating positive environmental impact while supporting the country in meeting its own climate targets , including increasing energy efficiency and reduc ing the GHG emissions. Alignment with/contribution to SDGs SDGs were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable developmen t by the year 2030. Green buildings are essential to advancing the SDGs and achieving transformational changes through the SDGs. 14 SHR’s green bond advance s the following SDG goal and target: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Green Buildings 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities 11.6 By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management . 11.B By 2020, substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters. Energy Efficiency 7. Affordable and Clean Energy 7 .3 By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency . Conclusion SHR , through its green bond issuance, intends to acquire new and/or existing green buildings and to refinanc e the existing loan/investment corporation bonds that have already been allocated to green buildings. By setting the eligibility threshold to the top levels of credible third - party certifications (DBJ Green Building Certification and CASBEE) , SHR ensures a robust f ramework for creating a positive environmenta l impact.

The programme is recognized as one of the leading regional standards. The certification is avail able for office buildings, logistics, residential & retail facilities. CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency) represents a green building management system from Japan, evaluating and rating the environmental performance o f buildings and the built environment. CASBEE is formed of four assessment tools tailored to different scales: housing, building, district and city. Certification levels 1 Star 2 Stars 3 Stars 4 Stars 5 Stars C (Poor) B - (Slightly Poor) B+ (Good) A (Very Good) S (Excellent) Areas of Assessment: Environmental Project Management Evaluation of DBJ Green Building Certification includes construction specifications, environmental features as well as social factors. CASBEE assesses two main factor s: inside and outside the building site, which translate into Q (Built Environment Quality) and, respectively, L (Built Environment Load). Areas of Assessment: Environmental Performance of the Building Assessment includes three areas. Each area includes a dditional subcategories: • Ecology • Risk management & amenities/diversity • Community & partnership • Energy Efficiency • Resource efficiency • Local environment • Indoor environment Requirements Score - based performance level There are three main areas comp ri sed of additional subcategories a full score of 100 points. In addition to the regular points, an additional point system is employed. In the final process, JREI will conduct on the ground review of building performance on the indicators above, and a committee set in JREI will decide the result of certification rank. 17 Score - based performance level CASBEE uses the BEE (Built Environment Efficiency) as its assessment indicator, which is calculated from Q (Built Environment Quality) as the numerator and L (Built Environment Load) as the denominator. Q and L are obtained through the classification and r earrangement of the four areas of assessment. Buildings may receive ranks ranging from C (poor) to S (excellent), in order of increasing BEE value. For authorization, a building must receive a report from the CASBEE Certification system, which is 15 Certification Overview, Development Bank of Japan: http://www.dbj.jp/en/service/finance/g_building/outline.html 16 CASBEE, BASBEE: http://www.ibec.or.jp/CASBEE/english/ 17 Process of certification (Japanese), DBJ Green Buildings : http://igb.jp/flow.html,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sekisui House Reit Green Bond 12 afterwa rds assessed by the local government.
