Since 1976, the Company has been primarily involved in exploring, developing, operating, and utilizing geothermal energy and other renewable energy sources for electricity generation. EDC has developed the EDC Green Bond Framewor k (the “ F ramework ”) under which it intends to issue green bon d s and use the proceeds to finance and refinance, in whole or in part, existing and future projects that may contribute to reduc ing the GHG emissions associated with power generation , primarily in the Philippines . The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in one area: 1. Renewable Energy EDC engaged Sustainalytics to review the EDC Green Bond Framework , dated February 2021 , and provide a S econd - P arty O pinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) . 1 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 2 Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ’ Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent 3 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which t he eligible project categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • T he Framework’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by International Capital Market Associatio n ( ICMA ) ; • The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and • The alignment of the issuer ’ s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds asse ssment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.6.1 , which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of EDC ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting asp ects of the Framework. EDC representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of EDC to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant inf ormation and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and shoul d be read in conjunction with that Framework. Any update of the present Second - Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and EDC . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the align ment of the Framework with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Pa rty Opinion opines on the potential allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ . 2 The EDC Green Bond Framework is available on Energy Development Corporation’s website at: https://www.energy.com.ph 3 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustainalytics and ensuring analyst independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust con flict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst in dependence, consistency of process, structural separation of commercial and research (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcomes. One of S ustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparency.,Second - Party Opinion EDC Green Bond Framework 3 No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or argument , either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that EDC has made available to Sustainalytics for the pu rpose of this Second - Party Opinion . Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the EDC Green Bond Framework Su stainalytics is of the opinion that the EDC Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns to the four core components of the GBP . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of EDC ’s G reen B ond F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible categor y , Renewable Energy , is aligned with those recognized by the GBP. Sustainalytics not e s that the proceeds of the green bond issued under the Framework activities are expected to increase the share of renewables in the power mix, and reduce the emissions associated with power generation , primarily in the Philippines . - ED C may invest in geothermal, wind, solar, hydropower, bioenergy, and energy storage projects. • For geothermal projects, are considered eligible projects with a carbon intensity below 100gCO 2 /kWh , which is in line with market practice. • Hydropower projects must observe a life - cycle carbon intensity below 100gCO 2 /kWh and have a power density greater than 5W/m 2 . EDC confirmed that all investment for new hydropower plants will include an environmental and social impact assessment by a credible body , and there will be no significant risk or expected negative impact identified. • EDC may finance bioenergy projects, i ncluding waste biomass to energy and non - waste to energy. The Company excludes the use of waste biomass from non - certified R oundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (“R SPO ”) operations. Non - waste to energy projects must observe a life - cycle GHG emission intensit y below 100gCO 2 /kWh or achieve a substantial reduction – at least 50 % – of life - cycle emissions relative to a fossil fuel baseline for biofuels. In addition, feedstock production must not occur on land with high biodiversity, or high amount of carbon before conversion to feedstock production and must not compete with food production. Non - waste biogas from peat, palm oil, and non - certified energy/oi l crops are excluded. Sustainalyti c s considers the criteria for bioenergy as credible , and encourages EDC to report on the feedstock use d in its reporting to provide further disclosure . • Energy storage projects may include electrochemical , mechanical , and p ower - to - gas projects. In the event of power - to - hydrogen, the project will be considered as eligible if carried through water electrolysis. Sustainalytics considers the criteria credible and aligned with market practice. - EDC has defined a two to three years look - back period for refinancing. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - EDC’s internal process in evaluating and selecting projects is handled by the Business Development team , in collaboration with various internal departments, such as th e Subsurface Geothermal Resources ; Facilities Operations and Maintenance ; Finance ; Strategic Initiatives, Legal and Regulatory ; Integrated Planning ; Strategy and Long Term Planning ; and Corporate Support Functions. The Business development team will ensure that the projects comply with the eligibility criteria set in the Framework. EDC’s Operations Committee and Board of Directors review and approve the projects. Based on these elements, Sustainalytics conside rs this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - The Finance team is responsible for the management of proceeds . EDC will regularly monitor the allocation through its internal information system. EDC aims at reaching full allocation within three years following green bon d issuance. Pending full allocation, EDC may temporarily invest,Second - Party Opinion EDC Green Bond Framework 4 proceeds in cash or cash equivalents, or use the proceeds to repay or prepay debts, 4 or use the proceeds following its internal liquidity management policies and strategies. Based on these el ements, Sustainalytics conside rs this process to be in line with market practice. • Reporting: - EDC intends to report on allocation of proceeds on its website on an annual basis until full allocation. Allocation reporting will include allocation of the net proceeds and balance of unallocated proceeds. In addition, EDC is committed to reporting on relevant impact metrics , including, but not limited to, installed capacity, electric ity generation , and GHG emissions reduction or avoidance . Based on these elements, Sustainalytics conside rs this process to be in line with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that the EDC Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP .

Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of EDC Contribution of framework to Energy Development Corporation ’s sustainability strategy As a renewable energy company, EDC has been implement ing sustainability practices since its incorporatio n in 1976. 5 T he Company's core mission is “to forge collabora tive pathways for a decarbonized and regenerative future. ” 5 Following its commitment, a s of 2019, EDC operates 1.2 GW of geothermal, 150 MW of wind, 132 MW of hydro, and 12 MW of solar. 5 In total, the Company's portfolio include s 1.5 GW of renewable energy added capacity. 5 Furthermore, compared to conventional coal - fired pow er plants, EDC’s portfolio avoided 8 . 2 Mt CO 2 e in 2019. 6 The Company is committed to reducing the carbon intensity of its power generation activities. 5 Between 2017 and 201 8 , EDC reduce d its carbon intensity by 1 . 3 %. 5 Furthermore, the carbon intensity reduction amounted to 5.4% between 2018 and 2019. 5 These reductions were achieved via the implementation of efficiency projects across the Company's operations, including power plant retrofitting cooling tower imp rovements and replacements, and planned outages to ensure preventive maintenance. 5 Furthermore, the Company aims at increasing renewable power generation to 9,555 G Wh, compared to 9,300 GWh in 2019. 5 , 7 The projects funded under the Framework aim at expanding EDC's renewable energy added capacities. Therefore, they are likely to increase EDC's renewable power generation and help the Company achieve its generation target. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the EDC Green Bond Framework is aligned with the C ompany’s overall sustainability strategy and initiatives and will further the Company’s action on its key environmental priorities. Well - positioned to address common environmental and social risks asso ciated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the net proceeds from the bonds issued under the Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are recognized by the GBP to have positive environmental impact, Sustainalytics is awa re that such eligible projects could also lead to negative environmental and social outcomes . Some key environmental and social risks associated with the eligible projects, could include worker health and safety, water withdrawal and discharge, emissions, and waste. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that EDC is able to manage and/or mitigate potential risks through implementation of the following: • EDC is committed to protecting the health and safety of its workforce and stakeholders affected by its operations. 8 To do so, the Company has implement ed a Health, Safety, and Environmental Management System. 8 Furthermore, EDC establish ed a framework for setting HSE objectives and targets and implement HSE programs that seek to reduce work - related incidents. 8 Between 2018 and 2019, EDC improved its s afety perfo rmance thanks to a 66% reduction in recordable incidents. 5 4 EDC has confirmed to Sustainalytics the exclusion of activities that are inherently emissions - intensive , such as coal or fossil - fuel technologies , from the refinancing of debt. 5 Energy Deve lopment Corporation, “2019 Integrated Report”, (2020), at: https://www.energy.com.ph/wp - content/uploads/2020/07/EDC - Integrated - Report - 2019_compre ssed.pdf 6 Based on EDC’s portfolio estimated carbon intensity (0.1 tCO 2 /MWh). 7 EDC has not yet fixed the date for its generation target and intends to update its report(s) when the target date has been se t. 8 Energy Development Corporation, “Our Health, Safety, and Environmental Policy”, (2021), at: https://www.energy.com.ph/about/,Second - Party Opinion EDC Green Bond Framework 5 • EDC's business model depends on freshwater supply for various purposes, such as cooling needs for geothermal plants or occasional wells drilling. 5 The Company is closely accounting for water withdrawal to reduce its water consumption, includin g surface water withdrawal and third - party provided water. 5 As for water discharge, EDC has implemented a “ Zero Discharge System ” in its geothermal sites. 5 EDC contains and re - inject geothermal water into the geothermal reservoir to preserve its geothermal resource and avoid the contamination of surface waters and shallow grou ndwater sources. 5 • Regarding emissions, EDC is committed to tracking its impact and accounting for all the applicable GHG emissions emitted during operations, foll owing the GHG Protocol. 5 Be tween 2018 and 2019, EDC reduce d its s cope 2 and scope 3 emissions by 7.2 %, and 10.7 %, respectively. 5 The Company’s s cope 1 emissions increased by 6 % over the same period , which is mainly due to the increase in power generation. 5 , 9 • EDC is committed to protecting the environment through pollution prevention . 5 The Company follows the waste hierarchy to minimize the disposal of waste in landfills. 5 For hazardous waste, EDC aims to reduce generation through process imp rovement and changes in raw materials use. 5 Hazardous wastes are transported, treated, and disposed of by third parties recognized by the Philippines’ Department of Environment and Natural Resources (“DENR”). 5 , 10 The Company monitors waste monthly and reports quarterly to the DENR. 5 • EDC also commits to the IFC Performance Standards on Environment and Social Sustainability. 11 The projects funded under the Framework undergo environmental and soc ial impact assessment. 2 Moreover, EDC has implemented an environmental management system to assess and mitigate environmental and social risks. 2 Based on these policies, standards and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that EDC has implemented adequate measures and is well - positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible categories. S ection 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds Increasing the share of renewables in the global and Philippines’ power mixes Globally, power production accounted for 38% of total energy - related CO 2 emissions in 2018. 12 In 2019 , fossil fuels accounted for 62 % of total power generation, including 3 6 % of total generation from coal, 23% from natural gas, and 3% from oil. 13 In 201 9 , renewables made up 2 8 % of total power generation worldwide. 13 Generation from renewables increased substantially between 2018 and 2019, including an 11.9% increase in wind generation and a 22.3% increase in solar photovoltaics generation. 13 Worldwide, GHG emissions from coal - fired power plants decreased by 3.1% in 2019 but coal remained the largest single source, with a 36% share of total generation. 13 In the Philippines, electricity generation accounted for 53.2% of total GHG emissions in 2019. 14 Between 2009 and 2019, the absolute emissions from power generation increased by 144 . 9%. 14 In 2019, total installed generation capacity in the Philippines totalled 25.5 GW, including 10.4 GW of coal, 4.3 GW of oil, 3.4 GW of natural gas, and 7.4 GW of renewable energy. 14 Power generation from coal increased by an average annual growth rate (“AAGR”) of 13.4% between 2015 and 2019, while renewable generation increased by an AAGR of 0.9% during the same period. 14 Neverthe less, t he Philippines have expressed interest in developing renewable energy added capacities to meet growing power demand and reduce its contribution to climate change. 15 Sustainalytics notes that the financing included in the Framework could further incr ease the share of renewables in the Philippines’s power mix and potentially reduce the contribution of power generation to climate change. 9 The Company has achieved to reduce its carbon intensity by 5.4% over the same period. 10 Department of Environment and Natural Resources, “DENR Mandate, Mission & Vision”, (1987), at: https://www.denr.gov.ph/index.php/about - us/mission - vision 11 IFC, “ IFC Performance Sta ndards on Environmental and Social Sustainability - Effective January 1, 2012 ”, (2012), at: http s://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/sustainability - at - ifc/publications/publications_handbook_pps 12 IEA, “Global Energy & CO2 Status Report”, (2019), at: https://www.iea.org/reports/global - energy - co2 - status - report - 2019/emissions 13 IEA, “Global Energy Review 2019”, ( 2020), at: https://www.iea.org/reports/gl obal - energy - review - 2019 14 Department of Energy, “Key Energy Statistics”, (2020), at: https://www.doe.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pdf/energy_stat istics/2019 - key - energy - statistics.pdf 15 International Trade Administration (USA), “Philippines Energy Market”, (2020), at: https://www.trade.gov/market - intelligence/philippines - energy - market#:~:text=The%20current%20energy%20mix%20is,current%20energy%20capacity%20at%2023GW .,Second - Party Opinion EDC Green Bond Framework 6 Sustainalytics considers tha t the projects are impactful and could help to decrease the GHG emissions of power produ ction in the Philippines and the countries where the projects may take place. Alignment with/ contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. The bond(s) issued under the EDC Green Bond Framework advances the following SDG and target: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Renewable Energy 7. Affordable and Clean Energ y 7.1. By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix Conclusion EDC has developed the EDC Green Bond Framework under which it will issue green bonds and the use of proceeds to finance and refinance renewable energy projects. Sustainalytics considers that the project s funded by the green bond proceeds are expected to reduce the GHG emissions associated with power generation , primarily in the Phil ippines . The EDC Green Bond Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the EDC Green Bond Framework is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the C ompany and that the green use of proceed s category will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goa ls 7. Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that EDC has adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Energy Development Corporation is well - positioned to issue green bonds and that th e EDC Green Bond Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the GBP.,Second - Party Opinion EDC Green Bond Framework 7 Appendi x Append ix 1 : Green B ond / Green Bond Programme - External Review Form Section 1.

Second - Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second - Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second - Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of proje cts intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with inte rnal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s intern al tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may v erify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scena rio. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion EDC Green Bond Framework 12 Disclaimer Copyright ©202 1 Sustainalytics.
