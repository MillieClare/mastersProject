C O M / E S G 1 3 o f 1 5 Introduction Established in 1950, Ellaktor Group (“Ellaktor” or “We”) is a diversified infrastructure group with a leading position in attractive sectors including Concessions, Renewables, Environment and Real Estate, underpinned by a presence in Construction. It has strong financial backing from local and international banks, wh ich provide both corporate and non - recourse funding. Ellaktor’s ‘Renewables’ business operates wind power, solar PV and hydro power generation throughout Greece with a total planned capacity of c.579MW by 2020. Ellaktor has been operating in renewable ener gy sources since 2000, via its subsidiary EL.TECH. ANEMOS, a company listed in ATHEX and in the process of merger by absorption with the parent company. EL.TECH. ANEMOS is the second largest wind energy producer in Greece with vast experience and knowhow i n the development, construction, operation and maintenance of wind parks. Regulatory support regime entails Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with guaranteed off - take by the market operator (DAPEEP). Moreover, the Greek Government has reaffrmed its intentio n to promote RES up to year 2030, by putting out for public consultation a policy package of specific quantitative supportive measures (National Energy Planning, Ministry of Environment and Energy, November 2018). Sustainability at Ellaktor The Group’s env ironmental policy is focused on two areas: • Use of environmental management systems to achieve maximum minimisation of the impact of projects on the environment, and taking initiatives on recycling, energy saving and the protection of flora and fauna. • Group operations in areas promoting environmental sustainability, such as wind and solar projects, as well as waste management, recycling and energy recovery from waste projects The existence of a Sustainability Department demonstrates the importance the Group is placing on this strategy; meanwhile the creation of the newly - established Regulatory Compliance Committee of ELLAKTOR Group, reflects fully our devotion to self - regulation and commitment above and beyond the legal obligations. Protection and respect of the environment is something that the Group and its subsidiaries have always been pursuing, and it is in this light that the Group adopted the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact. To ensure high Quality standards are met, the Quality department has deve loped a specific methodology for assessing the risk from an activity or product to the health of people, animals, plants and/ or the environment, and all risks have been analyzed and quantified on the basis of their consequences. Such assessment is mostly related to standards ISO45001:2018 (Occupational Health & Safety) and 14001:2015 (Environmental Management). But since the analysis and quantification parameters do not apply for standard ISO9001:2015, the Group’s Quality Management Department performed al l necessary reviews in all certified companies (e.g. AKTOR, TOMI, AKTOR FM, AKTOR CONCESSIONS, ATTIKES DIADROMES, MOREAS, etc.).,I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 4 o f 1 5 Green Bond Framework As part of our continued commitment to sustainability, we have developed a Green Bond Framework (the “Fram ework”) which is in accordance with the Green Bond Principles 2018 1 (the “GBP”) and under which Ellaktor can issue Green Bond(s). For each Green Bond issued, we will adopt the following as set out in this Framework: 1) Use of Proceeds, 2) Project Evaluation and Selection, 3) Management of Proceeds, and 4) Reporting 1. Use of Proceeds: The net proceeds from any Ellaktor Green Bond will be applied, in part or in full, to finance or refinance new and existing projects and assets meeting the following eligibility crite ria (“Eligible Green Projects”): ICMA GBP 2018 Project Category Eligibility Criteria Alignment with the UN SDG targets 2 Renewable Energy • Financing or refinancing of onshore wind, and solar PV energy generation projects and assets and assoc iated development / research / construction / production costs SDG 7.2: By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix 2. Project Selection: We will select projects and assets in alignment with the eligibility criteria defined above for inclusion into a Green Bond. Projects selected for inclusion will be selected based on compliance with the Climate Bonds Standard Sector Technical Requirements for ‘Wind Energy’ and ‘Solar Energy’. The Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Treasury Team will be responsible for selecting the projects in alignment with the eligibility criteria defined above. All the eligible projects will have secured Environmental P ermits from pertinent Authorities. These are issued acc. to Greek legislation (law 4014/2011) which is in line with EU Directives, following a comprehensive Environmental Impacts Assessment Study, the consideration of numerous official Opinions from variou s state agencies incl. Local Government and extensive public consultation (citizens, stakeholders & organizations). 1 Green Bond Principles 2018 - https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/documents/Regulatory/Green - Bonds/June - 2018/Green - Bond - Principles --- June - 2018 - 140618 - WEB.pdf 2 UN Sustainable Development Goals - https://www.un.org/su stainabledevelopment/sustainable - development - goals/,I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 5 o f 1 5 The Finance Department will be responsible of allocating the proceeds of the Green Bond to the selected portfolio of Eligible Green Projects . 3. Management of Proceeds: We will oversee the allocation and tracking of expenditures on Eligible Green Projects up to an amount equal to the net proceeds of Green Bond(s) issued. To manage this oversight, w e will establish a Green Bond Register. Pending allocation, the net proceeds of the Green Bond will be deposited in our general funding accounts and earmarked for allocation in the Green Bond Register. Pending allocation of the net proceeds, we may temporarily invest an amount equal to the balance of su ch proceeds in cash, cash equivalents and/or government securities, or repay other short - term borrowings. Payment of principal and interest on the Green Bond will be made from our general funds and will not be directly linked to the performance of any Eli gible Green Project. The Green Bond Register will be reviewed biannually by the Treasury Team. Proceeds are expected to be fully allocated within 24 months of issuance to new projects and / or refinancing of existing projects identified under the use of pr oceeds section above. Any net proceeds will not be invested in fossil fuel related projects. 4. Reporting: We will publish a report within one year from the issue date and thereafter on an annual basis, including: • Allocation reporting: • Breakdown of allocation of proceeds by nominated projects and assets, and; • Breakdown of allocation by geography; • Breakdown of allocation between refinancing and financing; and • Any unallocated proceeds • Impact reporting: Where possible, we will aim to provide the following impact metrics as a part of our annual reporting: • Renewable energy production (MWh) per year; and • CO2 emissions reduction/avoidance (tonnes of CO2 eq.) The report will be published as a part of our Sustainability Report on the company website https://ellaktor.com/en/sustainability - reports/ . 5. External Review: We will appoint an external party to provide verification of the Green Bond as an independent and approved verifier under the Climate Bond Standar d. We intend to appoint an external party to review our reporting as set forth above on an annual basis. Our references to any external criteria or standards are only in respect of such criteria or standards as in effect on the Issue Date.
