BTSG’s m ass transit unit , which accounts for the majority of the group’s revenue s , operates and maintains the Sky Train system, an elevated trackwork in Bangkok, covering 36 kilome ters of train tracks , and the Bus Rapid Transit system with 12 stations through 15 kilometers of dedicated bus lane. BTSG was founded in 1968 and is headquartered in Bangkok, Thailand. BTSG has developed the BTSG Green Bond Framework (the “ F ramework ”) under which it intends to issue green bonds and use the proceeds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and f uture projects that contribute to development of electrified transportation services and related - infrastructures while s upporting the company’s strategy and vision . The F ramework defines one eligibility criteri on: 1. Clean transportation and supporting infrastructure BTSG engaged Sustainalytics to review the BTSG Green Bond Framework , dated April 2019 and provide a second - party opinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) 2 and the ASEAN Green Bond Standards 2018 (the “AGBS”) 3 . This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 4 As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of BTSG ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of BTSG ’s green bond. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information.

Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds The use of proceed categor y is recognized as impactful by G reen B ond P rinciples . Importance of the shift towards mass and low carbon transit in Bangkok Thailand’s transportation sector relies 85% on road transportation , 22 mainly using private cars and motorcycles, increasing urban air pollution, decreasing safety , and increasing GHG emissions . 23 In addition , the transport sector accounts for more than one - third of final energy consumption, 24 and accounts for 19.2% of total GHG emission in Thailand 25 and 38% of GHG emissions in Bangkok. 26 T he rapid development of the Thai economy and its extensive rice - producing capacity 27 ma d e the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) the country’s most significant urban hub, accounting for almost 80% of the total urban area 28 and 22% of the total population 29 in Thailand. P opulation increase, and land use change have led to a rapid motorization in BMR , reaching a high level of motorcycle and car ownership before a mass transit systems were 17 Notification of Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment: https://www.jetro.go.jp/ext_images/thailand/pdf/iee_chonburi.pdf 18 The OHSAS 18001 an international standard designed to enable organisations to control risks and improve performance in the area of occupational health and safety. 19 ISO 14001 is an international standard that specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system (EMS) 20 BTSG Safety Policy http://www.btsgroup.co.th/en/sustainability/sustainable - performances/relevant - policies 21 BTSG Sustainability Report 2017/2018 pg. 89: http://www.btsgroup.co.th/storage/download/sustainability/sr/bts - sd201718 - en.pdf 22 Transportation Infrastructure in Thailand: Go Green or Go Grey, ACTS: http://www.uncrd.or.jp/content/documents/5602Presentation%205%20 - %20Module%202%20 - %20Mr.%20Surachet%20Pravinvongvuth.pdf 23 Pri vate Motorized Transport, Bangkok, Thailand, Natcha Tulyasuwan, 2013 https://unhabitat.org/wp - content/uploads/2013/06/GRHS.2013.Case_.Study_.Bangko k.Thailand.pdf 24 Thailand: Clean Energy for Green Low - Carbon Growth: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/576401468120848097/pdf/66 2200WP0p12440e0Clean0Energy0all07.pdf 25 OTP and GIZ Strengthen the Movement on Low Carbon Mobility: https://www.transportandcli matechange.org/2019/01/31/otp - and - giz - strengthen - the - movements - on - low - carbon - mobility/ 26 Private Motorized Transport, Bangkok, Thailand, Natcha Tulyasuwan, 2013 https://unhabitat.org/wp - content/uploads/2013/06/GRHS.2013.Case_.Study_.Bangkok.Thailand.pdf 27 Private Motorized Transport, Bangkok, Thailand, Natcha Tulyasuwan, 2013 https://unhabitat.org/wp - content/uploads/2013/06/GRHS.2013.Case_.Study_.Bangkok.Thailand.pdf 28 Urbanization in Thailand is Dominated by the Bangkok Urban Area: http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/01/26/urbanization - in - thailand - is - dominated - by - the - bangkok - urban - area 29 Capital Facts for Bangkok, Thailand: https://www.worldscapitalcities.com/capital - facts - for - bangkok - thailand/,Second - Party Opinion BTSG Green Bond 6 establish ed . 30 To mitigate mobility challenges and foster a shift towards mass and low carbon transit , the G overnment of Thailand adopted several transportation targets in its 12 th National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017 - 2021) 31 such as raising the proportion of passengers using public transportation systems, fostering the construction of mass - transit city - rail projects in the BRM, and expanding the mass rapid transit lines in BRM. In addition, the Government of Thailand set its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution in 2015 , 32 aiming to reduce GHG emissions by 20% from the projected business - as - usual (BAU) level by 2030 or a reduction of approximately 555 MtCO 2e , compared to 2005 levels . Moreover, the Bangkok Action Plan on Global Warming Mitiga tion (2013 - 2023) 33 includes a set of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures including environmentally sustainable transport and green urban planning. Since BTSG intends to use its green bond proceeds to invest in clean transportation assets , including electrified mass transit, and supporting infrastructure, Sustainalytics considers that BTSG’s investments will contribute to Thailand’s mobility and GHG emissions targets and foster a shift towards electrified mass transit in Bangkok. Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. T his green bond advances the following SDG goal and target s : Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target s Clean transportation and supporting infrastructure 11 . Sustainable Cities and Commu nities 11.2 By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible a nd sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons. 11.6 By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management Conclusion BTSG developed the BTSG Green Bond Framework under which it intends to issue green bonds to finance c lean transportation projects including electric mass transit and i nfrastructure supporting clean transportation operations which will reduce Bangkok’s environmental footprint through assisting the shift to wards public and low carbon mobility and positively contribute to Thailand’s GHG reduction and clean transportation goals . Sustainalytics assessed the framework and found that it aligns with the Green Bond Principles 2018, and the ASEAN Green Bond Standards 201 8. BTSG’s processes for project selection and evaluation, management of proceeds and reporting are in alignment with market practice. Based on the above, Sustainalytics considers the BTSG Green Bond Framework to be credible, robust and transparent. 30 Transport, urban structure and ‘lock - in’ in the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/docs/default - source/faculty - publications/paul - a - barter/barter - lockin - in - kl - idpr - paper.pdf?sfvrsn=9230940b_2 31 The 12 th National Economic and Social Development Plan of Thailand: https://www.nesdb.go.th/nesdb_en/ewt_w3c/ewt_dl_link.php?nid=4345 32 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution an d Relevant Information: https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Thailand/1/Thailand_INDC.pdf 33 Bangkok Master Pla n on Climate Change 2013 - 2023 http://www.mayorsforpeace.org/english/whatsnew/activity/data/2018/Bangkok_Master_Plan_on_Climate_Chang e.pdf,Second - Party Opinion BTSG Green Bond 7 App endices Appendix 1: Alignment to the ASEAN Green Bond Standards ASEAN Green Bond Standards’ Criteria Alignment with ASEAN GBS Sustainalytics’ comments on alignment with the ASEAN Green Bond Standards.

Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s a dviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projec ts intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with inter nal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s interna l tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may ve rify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenar io. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion BTSG Green Bond 14 Disclaimer © Sustainalytics 201 9 .
