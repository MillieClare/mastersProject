 1 / 15 SECOND PARTY OPINION 1 ON THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE GREEN BOND FRAMEWORK 2 OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION April 10 , 201 9 SCOPE Vigeo Eiris was commissioned to provide an independent opinion on the sustainability credentials and management of the Green Bond Framework dated 28 March 2019 ( hereafter the “ Framework ”) created by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (the “ I ssuer” or “ HKSAR Government ” ) to govern the Green Bonds issuances (all the potential bonds to be issued under the Framework in 2019 and referred as the “Bonds” hereafter) . O ur assessment is established according to our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) exclus ive assessment methodology 3 and to the International Capital Market Association’ s Green Bond Principles voluntary guidelines edit ed in June 2018 (“GBP 2018 ”). Our opinion on the contemplated Green Bonds is built on the review of the Framework, including the assessment of the coherence between the Framework and the Issuer’s environmental commitments, its potential contribution to sustainability and its alignment with the four core components of the GBP 2018 4 . Our sources of information are multichannel, combining public information , documents provided by the Issuer and data from interviews with Issuer’s managers and stakeholders involved in th e Green Bond s issuance held via a telecommunications system. We carried out our due diligence assessment from February 4 th to April 10 th , 201 9 . We consider that we were provided with access to all the appropriate documents and interviewees we solicited . We consider that the informatio n provided enable s us to establish our opinion with a reasonable level of assurance on its completeness, precision and reliability . VIGEO EIRIS’ OPINION Vigeo Eiris is of the opinion that the Green Bond Framework of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is aligned with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018 . We express a reasonable assurance 5 (our highest level of assurance) on the Issuer’s commitments and on the contribution of the contemplated Bonds to sustainability . 1) Issuance : The Issuer has described and formalized the main characteristics of the Bond s within a Green Bond Framework (the “Framework”) , dated March 28 , 2019 and committed to mak ing t his document publicly accessible on HKSAR Government Green Bond Programme website, in line with good market practices. We are of the opinion that the Green Bond Framework is coherent with HKSAR Government’s publicly disclosed strategic sustainab le development priorities and sector issues , and that it contributes to achieve its sustainab le development commitments and targets . Use of Proceeds  The net proceeds of the Bonds will exclusively finance or refinance, in full or in part, projects falling under eight Eligible Categories (“ Eligible Projects”), which are formalized and publicly disclosed in the Framework, namely: Renewable energy, Energy efficiency and conservation, Pollution prevention and control, Waste management and resource recovery, Water and wastewater management, Natu re conservation/biodiversity, Clean Transportation and Green buildings. We consider that Eligible Categories are clearly defined . 1 This opinion is to be considered as the “Second Party Opinion” described in the GBP voluntary guidelines 2018 Edition by the International Capital Market Association ( www.icmagroup.org ). 2 HKSAR Government’s Green Bond Framework dated 28 March 2019 . 3 Vigeo Eiris ESG exclusive assessment methodology is used to analyse the issuance, in particular to assess the potential environmental and social benefits of Eligible Projects and to analyse the identification and management of environmental, social and governance risks associated t o the Eligible Projects. 4 HKSAR Government’s ESG performance assessment was not within the scope of evaluation of this Second Part y Opinion. 5 Definition of Vigeo Eiris’ scales of assessment (as detailed in the Methodology section)., 2 / 15 Use of Proceeds (continued) Eligible Projects are intended to contribute to six main environmental objectives, namely: climate change mitigation and adaptation, pollution prevention and control, biodiversity conservation, conservation and sustainable management of water resources and air quality improvement. These objectives are formalized in the Framework and considered clearly defined and relevant. Eligible Projects are considered to provide clear environmental benefits. The Issuer will assess and quantify, as feasible, the expecte d environmental benefits. We have suggested defining ex - ante precise quantified environmental targets of each of the Eligible Categories. In addition, Eligible Projects are likely to contribute to eight United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SD Gs”), namely: Goal 3. Good Health and Well - being, Goal 6. Clean Water and sanitation, Goal 7. Affordable and Clean energy, Goal 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, Goal 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities, Goal 12. Responsible Consumption and Pr oduction, Goal 13. Climate Action, and Goal 15. Life on Land . The Issuer has transparently communicated the look - back period for refinanced Eligible Projects, namely those included in HKSAR Government budget for the last two financial years 6 , in line with best market practices. In addition, the Issuer has declared that for its first Green Bond issuance the estimated share of refinancing will be lower than 50% of the total net proceeds. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection  The governance and the process for the evaluation and selection of the Eligible Projects are formalized in the Framework and the public documents related to HKSAR Government Public Works Programme. We consider that the process is transparent and relevant. The process relies on e xplicit and relevant eligibility criteria (selection and exclusion). The identification and management of the environmental and social (E&S) risks associated with the Eligible Projects are considered to be good, covering the identification, monitoring and control of the relevant E&S risks in all the Eligible Projects. Management of Proceeds  The rules for the management of proceeds are clearly defined. The net proceeds of the Bond will be credited to the Capital Works Reserve Fund and appropriately tracked b y the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) using a formal internal register. Unallocated proceeds will be placed in the Exchange Fund, which is part of Hong Kong’s fiscal reserve that keeps the funds in the form of cash or cash equivalent. The Steering Committee will annually verify that the net proceeds of the Bonds match the allocations to Eligible Projects and an independent qualified party will verify the internal register kept by FSTB once a year, at least until full allocation of the proc eeds. Reporting The reporting process and commitments of the Issuer appear to be good, covering both the funds allocation and the environmental benefits of the Eligible Projects. In addition, HKSAR Government ’s Green Bond s issuance s are and will be supported by external reviews: - A pre - issuance consultant review : in the form of a publicly available Second Party Opinion (“SPO”) delivered by Vigeo Eiris on the sustainability credentials of the Framework . - An annual verification : performed by a n independent party, who will verify the internal register maintained by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau covering the Green Bonds Transaction details and allocation of proceeds, including the assessed environmental benefits of the Bonds . The Second Party Opinion is based on the review of the F ramework according to the GBP 2018.

Context note : Asia and the Pacific account for more than 50 per cent of global Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions. Main urban area and cities of the region have therefore th e great potential to play a key role driving significant positive changes towards sustainable development and environmental protection. By implementing actions targeting clean transportation, urban planning, green buildings, energy efficiency or waste and water management, major cities could effectively support the attainment of the goals of the Paris Agreement and drive meaningful, measurable and sustainable action on climate change. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region appears to acknowledge its role in addressing these challenges and has formalized several strategies and environmental policies coupled in some cases with quantified targets, including but not limited to: - Pollution prevention and control plans: - “Clean Air Plan for Hong Kong” issued in 2013, targeting the reduction of air pollution and lower public health risks; - “Harbour Area Treatment Scheme” (HATS) and the “Sewerage Master Plans” (SMPs) addressing water quality improvement in Hong Kong; - “Hong Kong Blueprint for Sustainable Use of resources 2013 – 2022” addressing waste management; - “ Hong Kong Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 2016 - 2021 ” (BSAP) towards Biodiversity protection within and outside Hong Kong; - Green Government Buildings Circular for government buildings, setting spec ific requirements in terms of, among other things, energy efficiency and targeted ratings of green building certification ; - “Energy Saving Plan” setting the target of reducing Hong Kong’s energy intensity by 40% by 2025 using 2005 as the base ; - “Railway Development Strategy 2014” and other dedicated plans focus ed on the expansion of the r ailway network in Hong Kong to respond to mobility, traffic congestion and pollution challenges. In addition to these thematic strategies, the “Hong Kong’s Clima te Action Plan 2030+” sets out global carbon emissions reduction targets, namely to reduce the carbon intensity (carbon per unit of GDP) by 65% to 70% by 2030 compared to 2005 data. By creating a Framework to issue Bonds to finance or refinance projects related to renewable energy, energy efficiency and conservation, pollution prevention and control, waste management and resource recovery, water and wastewater management, nature conservation/biodiversity, clean transportation and green buildings , the HKSA R Government coherently aligns with its sustainability strategy and commitments and addresses main issues in terms of cities’ environmental responsibility., 4 / 15 Use of proceeds The net proceeds of the Bonds will exclusively finance or refinance, in full or in part, projects falling under eight Eligible Categories (“ Eligible Projects”), which are formalized and publicly disclosed in the Framework, namely: Renewable energy, Energy efficiency and conservation, Pollution prevention and control, Waste management and resource recovery, Water and wastewater management, Nature conservation/biodiversity, Clean Transportation and Green buildings.

We consider that the process is transparent and relevant. - The process for the evaluation and selection of Eligible Projects is reasonably structured. - The governance is based on relevant HKSAR Government expertise , with well - defined roles and responsibilities. HKSAR Government procedure: - HKSAR Government has formalized th e Public Works Programme ( PWP) to govern and control all public works projects of non - recurrent nature . The PWP financing is managed through the Capital Works Reserve Fund (CWRF). The CWRF was established as a Resolution passed by Hong Kong’s Legislative Council , which states that the fund is to be administered by the Finance Secretary. T he approval power of public works projects is vested with the Finance Committee (FC) or public officers under the delegated authority . The Public Works Subcommittee (PWSC) falls under the FC and its role is to examine public works expenditures and make recommendations to the FC. - The PWP has clearly structured the stages for the approval of public work project s , from its conception to its implementation that explicitly determine the authority, responsibilities and the specific requirement s that must be completed at each sta g e: - Category D: smaller projects/consultancies estimated to cost not more than the prevailing financial ceiling ($30M). Finance Committee has delegated to the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau the approval of funding for Category D projects. - Category B: The inclusion of the public work project in the PWP of which i ts preliminary technical feasibility is established on a prima facie basis. Once all pro c edures are completed, the director of the relevant works department seek funding for the project from the legislature through the presentation of the PWSC paper . - Category A: The approval of the FC upgrades the project to Category A status with finding approval. - After receipt of competitive tenders, the authority to accept a tender shall be given from either the relevant tender board or the Controlling Officers, dep ending on the value of the contract and whether the contract is awarded to the highest combined price - quality scorer or not . When the authority has given its approval, the works department can accept the tender and get construction under way. Bond s procedure: - HKSAR Government has set up the S teering C ommittee on the Government Green Bond Programme (SC) , which is responsible for the review and approval of the allocation of proceeds to Eligible Projects. The SC is chaired by the Financial Secretary an d comprise the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, the Secretary for the Environment and Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. - The verification and traceability are ensured throughout the process: - The SC will annually verify that the Eligible Projects financed by the Bond continue to comply with the eligibility criteria, and minutes of each meeting will be created to ensure decision traceability. - We have recommended that an independent party verifi es the compliance of Eligible Projects with the eligibility criteria ., 10 / 15 The process relies on explicit and relevant eligibility criteria (selection and exclusion ) . - The eligibility requirements are based on the definitions of the Eligible C ategories . - All Eligible Projects will be located within the territory of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. - In addition, the Issuer has considered clear and formalized exclusion criteria, namely: - F ossil fuel - based electric power generation or improvement in the eff iciency of fossil fuel - based electric power generation. - L arge scale hydropower plants (larger than 20 MW). - Biomass energy generation that depletes existing terrestrial carbon pools. The identification and management of the environmental and social (E&S) risks associated with the Eligible Projects are considered to be good , covering the identification, monitoring and control of the relevant E&S risks in all the categories of Eligible Projects. HKSAR Government has formalized procedures to govern the develo pment, construction and operation of public works, namely the Public Works Program me (PWP) . We consider that these procedures are exhaustive and adequately structured, covering the identification, monitoring and control of the relevant E&S risks in all the Eligible Projects: The PWP procedures explicitly state the mandatory E&S requirements for a project to be approved for funding and the government authorities responsible for each stage of the project planning process . While tasks differ from one type of p roject to another, the general procedures and sequence of stages apply to all Eligible Projects to be financed or refinanced by the Bonds. The monitoring and reporting of all projects financed by HKSAR Government is ensured through a register in the Publi c Works Programme Information System (PWPIS) and the publicly available Quarterly Report on Public Works Programme. In addition, the procedures to monitor and control the environmental and social performance of contractors and suppliers entering into contracts for public works are formalized in the Contractor Management Handbook , which is publicly accessible. The Handbook includes : - E xplicit procedures for the admission of contractors and suppliers in the List of Approved Contractors for Public Works or the List of Approved Suppliers of Material and Specialist Contractors of Public Works. ( hereafter “ the List/Specialist List”). Contractors and suppliers, who would like to apply for admission into the List/Specialist List, must comply with a number of cri teria covering, but not limited to, financial, technical and management experience and personnel as well as applicable legislation and regulations, including, for example, the statutory minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Ordinance. These approval criteria are in line with the E&S criteria recommended by Vigeo Eiris covering the respect to human and labour rights, respect to working conditions including minimum wage and maximum working hours, ensure appropriate health and safety conditions and prevent corruptio n, fraud and conflict of interest. In addition, consultants and contractors are required to provide certification of their quality management systems in accordance with ISO 9001:2015 standard and declaration of Conflict of interest . - A central record system is maintained to monitor the workload, performance and financial status of contractors and suppliers entering into contracts for public works, the Report on Contracto r ’ s Performance (RCP). The RCP is a scorecard that assess es 1 1 relevant criteria and sub - criteria . The first ten criteria assessed are: workmanship, progress, site safety, environmental pollution control, organization, general obligations, industry awareness, resources, design and attendance to emergency. Their assessment is based on a five - sc ale evaluation: very good, good, satisfactory, poor and very poor. The remaining criteria is the contractor’s attitude to claim s and is based on a two - scale evaluation: reasonable/no claim submitted and unreasonable. The assessment of the performance of contractors includes onsite monitoring visits. - The formalized Regulating Actions include the removal, suspension, downgrading or demotion of contract /supplier from the List/Specialist List, i f a contractor or supplier fail s to comply with the standards set in the Handbook including , but not limited to, unsatisfactory performance, misconduct or suspected misconduct, winding - up, bankruptcy or other financial problems, poor site safety record, poor environmental performanc e, and violation to Hong Kong laws., 11 / 15 Public Works Program E&S due diligence procedures: - In order to be considered part of the Public Works Programme, all Eligible Projects have to deliver the following relevant documents: - The Project Definition Statement in which the need o f the project and the potential contribution to local development is justified and the compliance with HKSAR Government policies, policy committees and basic planning standards for the development is confirmed. - Technical Feasibility Stat ement including: - Detailed p roject description , land requirements , d evelopment constraints (geotechnical aspects , management of construction and demolition material, interface problems, traffic impact, etc.) , management of contaminated sites, heritage considerations and greening and landscape considerations. - Environmental considerations: categorization of the project under or not under the Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance (EIAO). Project s under EIAO are required to conduct an EIA study in accor dance with the Technical Memorandum on EIA Process or seek permission to apply directly for an Environmental Permit. Other projects should provide dedicated measures to implement standard pollution control measures during construction or to carry out a Pre liminary Environmental Review of the project, as appropriate. - Further feasibility studies if considered needed. Of note, the engagement of consultants to conduct feasibility studies is structured in a formalized procedure that includes price ceilings. - Sustainability Evaluations conducted at the early planning stage of a proposal. Examples of these evaluations include the regional or sub - regional planning studies, comprehensive transport studies, waste management plans, etc. - The PWSC paper, which is requ ired for the submission of a project for approval under the PWP. This paper contains similar elements of the Technical Feasibility Statement plus the completed detailed design and tender documents required based on the nature of the project . - If the pro ject cost estimate is $200M , the Systematic Risk Management has to be implemented . This system includes annual monitoring using a Risk Register , from the project’s inclusion in the PWP until the completion of the project . - The PWP has a formalized framework of dispute resolution procedures with contractors and suppliers divided in three stages: a decision of the e ngineer, mediation and arbitration. - The PWP mandates the consultation with the relevant government departments, district councils , rural committees, and local and industry stakeholders to ensure smooth coordination . In addition , HKSAR Government has a formalized procedure to confidentially receive and manage complaints from members of the public throughout the lifetime of the project., 12 / 15 Management of proceeds The rules for the management of proceeds are clearly defined . The allocation and tracking process es are clearly defined and formalized in the Framework : - The net proceeds of the Bond will be credited to the Capital Works Reserve Fund and managed by FSTB, using a formal internal register . We consider this procedure allows the appropriate tracking of proceeds . - The issuer has transparently communicated the intende d type of temporary placement for the unallocated proceeds . This will be placed in the E xchange Fund, which is part of Hong Kong’s fiscal reserve that keeps the funds in the form of cash or cash equivalent. We have recommended committing to allocat e the net proceeds within a 24 months period after the issuance date, in line with best market practices. - In case of project postponement, or if a project fails to comply with the eligibility criteria, HKSAR Government committed to reallocat ing the funds to other E ligible P roject within 12 months. T he eventual changes in the Bond’s portfolio will be reported in the Bond’s reports. The traceability and verification are ensured throughout the process . - The SC will annually verify that the net proceeds of the Bond match the allocations to Eligible Projects. - An independent qualified party will verify the internal allocation of proceeds record kept by FSTB once a year , at least until full allocation of the proceeds . Monitoring & Reporting The reporting process and commitments appear to be good, covering both the funds allocation and the environmental benefits of the Eligible Projects . The process for monitoring, data collection, consolidation and reporting are clearly defined by the Issuer in internal documentation. We have recommended formalizing this process in the Framework. The process is based on relevant expertise: - The relevant public works departments will be responsible for monitoring the environmental benefits data associated to the Eligible Projects. - FSTB will be responsible for monitoring the allocation of proceeds data, f or collecting and consolidating the environmental benefits data and for creating the Green Bond reports. The Issuer has committed to annually report ing on the Bond s , until full allocation and later in case of material changes, through t he Green Bond Reports which will be publicly accessible on HKSAR Government Green Bond Programme website.

ISSUANCE The Bond has been evaluated by Vigeo Eiris according to the Green Bond Principles Voluntary Guidelines (2018 Edition ) and to our exclusive methodology based on applying international standards and sector guidelines in terms of ESG management and assessment. Coherence of the Issuance We assess the coherence between the Bond issuance and the Issuer’s strategy and main sustainability issues. Use of proceeds The use of proceeds guidelines is defined to ensure that the net proceeds of the Bonds are exclusively used to finance and/or refinance Eligible Projects and are traceable within the issuing organization . The projects endorsed shall comply with the eligible categories and with the eligibility criteria in order to be considered as Eligible Projects . Vigeo Eiris evaluates the formalization and relevance of the categories; the relevance, preciseness of the associated environmental objectives ; the definition, precision and measurability of the expected environmental benefits from the B ond and if they are assessed and quantified . The contribution of Eligible Projects to sustainable development is evaluated based on the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and on its associated targets . Process for evaluation and selection The evaluation and selection process have been assessed by Vigeo Eiris regarding its transparency, governance and efficiency. The explicitness of eligibility criteria and associated supporting elements integrated in the Bond issuance , and the coherence of the process are analysed based on material ESG issues considered in Vigeo Eiris’ methodology. Management of proceeds The rules for the management of proceeds and the allocation process have been evaluated by Vigeo Eiris regar ding their transparency, coherence and efficiency. Reporting Reporting indicators, processes and methodologies are defined by the Issuer to enable annual reporting on fund allocation, environmental benefits (output and impact indicators) and on the responsible management of Eligible Projects financed by the Bond s proceeds , collected at project level and potentially aggregated at Bond and/ or asset level.
