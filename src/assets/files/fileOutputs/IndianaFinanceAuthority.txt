New Category,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 1 Second Party Opinion Issuer: Indiana Finance Authority Issue Description: Taxable Private Activity Refunding Bonds (Ohio River Bridges East End Crossing Project), Series 2021 (Green Bonds) Project: Ohio River Bridges East End Crossing Project Green Standard: Green Bond Principles Green Category: Sustainable Infrastructure Par: $527,645,000 Evaluation Date: September 9, 2021 GREEN BONDS DESIGNATION Kestrel Verifiers, an Approved Verifier accredited by the Climate Bonds Initiative, conducted an independent external review of this bond to evaluate conformance with the Green Bond Principles (June 2021) established by the International Capital Market Association. This Second Party Opinion reflects our review of the uses and allocation of proceeds, and oversight and conformance of the bonds with the Green Bond Principles. In our opinion, the Taxable Private Activity Refunding Bonds (Ohio River Bridges East End Crossing Project), Series 2021 (Green Bonds) (“Series 2021 Bonds”) are aligned with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles and qualify for Green Bonds designation. ABOUT THE ISSUER The Indiana Finance Authority is a body politic and corporate entity separate from the State of Indiana but exercising an essential government function. The mission of the Indiana Finance Authority is to oversee State-related debt issuance and provide efficient and effective financing solutions to facilitate state and local government and business investment in Indiana. There are five statutory members of the Indiana Finance Authority including Directors of the State Budget Agency, the Treasurer of the State, and three other members appointed by the Governor. The Indiana Finance Authority has two separate roles in the Ohio River Bridges East End Crossing Project: (1) as “conduit issuer” of the Series 2021 Bonds, and (2) as party to the Public Private Agreement. Additional parties to the Public Private Agreement include the East End Crossing Partners, LLC. ABOUT THE BORROWERS The East End Crossing Partners, LLC (the “Company”) is the beneficiary of the Series 2021 Bonds issued by Indiana Finance Authority. The Company, held by VINCI Concessions Investments USA Inc. (“VINCI”), and BBGI East End Holdings Inc. (“BBGI”), entered into a Public Private Agreement with the Indiana Finance Authority to design, build and finance the Project and operate and maintain a specific portion of the Project until 2051. VINCI designs, finances, builds, operates and maintains nearly 80 airports, highways and rail projects in 24 countries, through its subsidiaries VINCI Airports, VINCI Highways and VINCI Railways. VINCI takes an,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 2 innovative approach toward mobility climate resilience and sharing growth with the regions in which they work. Principles of sustainability are central to operations and management at VINCI, as demonstrated by the company’s recent commitment to reducing direct greenhouse gases emissions by 40% by the year 2030 (compared to 2018). BBGI is an infrastructure investment company incorporated in Luxembourg, listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, and regulated by the Comission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, a public institution which supervises the professionals and products of the Luxembourg financial sector. As signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (“UN PRI”), BBGI has demonstrated a commitment to responsible investing that is driving change toward a more sustainable world. In 2020 BBGI’s reporting through UN PRI received an ‘A’ rating for strategy, governance, and infrastructure. The Project The Ohio River Bridges East End Crossing Project, completed in 2016, is a cross-river transportation and roadway project implemented via a public-private partnership between the Indiana Department of Transportation, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, Indiana Finance Authority, VINCI, BBGI, and Walsh Construction Company. Designed to meet current and future mobility needs of the Louisville Metropolitan Area, the Project includes a cable-stayed bridge (now called the Lewis and Clark Bridge) across the Ohio River connecting Clark County, Indiana, with Jefferson County, Kentucky, and associated roadways, tunnels and facilities. Benefits of the Project include:  Addressing long-term mobility challenges of the region;  Increasing cross-river mobility;  Improving safety and alleviating traffic congestion;  Integrating with existing highways; and  Stimulating the economy. ALIGNMENT TO GREEN STANDARDS Green Bonds are any type of bond instrument where the proceeds will be exclusively applied to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new and/or existing eligible Green Projects and which are aligned with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles (International Capital Market Association definition). In preparing this Opinion, Kestrel Verifiers recognized the need to establish a new eligible project category: Sustainable Infrastructure. In Kestrel Verifiers’ view, eligible projects in the Sustainable Infrastructure category are aligned with the Envision Sustainable Infrastructure Framework and demonstrate the following: effective collaboration among project teams and communities, a commitment to stewardship and restoration of natural resources, the advancement of social equity within communities, and a resilience to physical and transitional climate risks. More information on the Envision Sustainable Infrastructure Framework can be found on the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure website: https://sustainableinfrastructure.org/ Use of Proceeds The Series 2021 Bonds will be loaned to the East End Crossing Partners, LLC (“Company”) to refund Indiana Finance Authority’s outstanding Tax-Exempt Private Activity Bonds (Ohio River Bridges East End Crossing Project), Series 2013 A (“Series 2013A Bonds”) and to pay the costs of issuance. The Ohio River Bridges East End Crossing Project (“Project”) that was partially financed by the Series 2013A Bonds is an eligible project as per the Green Bond Principles in the project category of Sustainable Infrastructure . The Project achieved an Envision Platinum certification in 2016 from the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure, by demonstrating comprehensive integration of principles of sustainability through all stages of the Project. Green Standard Eligible Project Category: Sustainable Infrastructure,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 3 Envision Framework and Sustainable Design Envision is a sustainability framework and rating system for physical infrastructure developed in partnership between Harvard University Graduate School of Design and the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure (“ISI”), which was founded by the American Public Works Association, the American Council of Engineering Companies, and the American Society of Civil Engineers.1 The Envision framework is widely accepted and promoted by the American Society of Civil Engineers as a best practice for sustainable design. Just as LEED2 is a recognizable standard for green building design, Envision is a recognizable standard for sustainable infrastructure of all types. The Envision framework includes 64 sustainability and resilience indicators (“credits”) organized around five categories ( Quality of Life, Leadership, Resource Allocation, Natural World, and Climate and Resilience ) that collectively address components of community development, human health and well-being, mobility and emissions, wildlife conservation, life cycles of materials, and more. The Ohio River Bridges East End Crossing Project received an Envision Platinum certification in 2016 as the first Envision project involving (i) a highway, (ii) a river bridge, (iii) a roadway tunnel and (iv) a bi-state location.3 Parsons acted as a third-party verifier for the certification which was issued by the ISI. The Project earned high marks on Quality of Life, Leadership, and Climate and Resilience as outlined below. The Project is exemplary in its comprehensive consideration of vulnerabilities to climate change and restoration of ecosystem functions. During construction, at least 80% of excavated material was beneficially reused on site and all disturbed soils were restored to a functional state. The majority of materials, plants, and soils used in construction were locally sourced, as defined by the Envision framework. The full Envision Evaluation Assessment is provided in Appendix B. Envision Category Definition Areas of High Achievement Leadership – Establish a Sustainability Management System (LD1.2) A sustainability management system integrates a sustainability policy into project decision- making. The Project has a Sustainability Management Plan with specific Key Performance Indicators measured throughout construction and operation. Metrics are grouped into four categories: People & Communities , Biodiversity & Natural Resources , Climate Change & Energy , and Governance & Partnerships . Leadership - Provide for Stakeholder Involvement (LD1.4) Infrastructure demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of sustainability (environmental and social impacts) has been developed and implemented with extensive input from the public, regulators, and consultants. The Project achieved the highest possible level of achievement by proactively seeking out and responding to diverse stakeholder concerns and opinions throughout the design, risk assessment, and construction stages. A Project-specific Public Involvement Plan, Community Outreach Plan, and Communication Plan established methodologies for effective communication. Features such as noise barriers and aesthetic elements were added as a result of stakeholder involvement. In Kestrel’s view, high achievement in this credit is particularly notable due to the complexity and breadth of state, federal, and local involvement. Climate and Resilience – Assess Climate Threat (CR2.1) A comprehensive understanding of climate risks associated with any new infrastructure project is critical to the long-term sustainability of the asset. The Project achieved the highest possible level of achievement by completing a climate impact assessment and adaptation plan that included vulnerability, risk, and adaptation assessments. Quality of Life - Develop Local Skills and Capabilities (QL1.3) Infrastructure projects offer opportunities for workforce training which can have far- reaching and prolonged positive impacts on communities. The Project received the highest possible score by prioritizing development of a local, skilled workforce and encouraging involvement of Disadvantaged Business Enterprises through all stages of the Project. Project managers worked collaboratively with local labor unions, recruited trainees, implemented on- the-job training programs, and partnered with community organizations, including local colleges and high schools, to implement training programs. 1 The Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure is a nonprofit education and research organization. 2 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a green building rating system developed by the US Green Building Council 3 The Project received nearly a dozen awards including Bond Buyer’s 2013 Deal of the Year and ARTBA 2013 P3 Project of the Year .,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 4 Additional elements contributing to the Platinum certification include:  a design to withstand a 500 - year flood;  a 100-year design life;  pavement tailored to withstand local temperature extremes and reduce stormwater runoff;  salt management to protect water quality;  LED lighting;  anti-idling devices on maintenance vehicles;  solar trash compactors;4  non-motorized access; and  significant reduction of traffic congestion. The Project is complete, and ongoing operations and maintenance will follow a comprehensive maintenance plan. Several innovative operations and maintenance practices are currently planned or in discussion by BBGI and VINCI. These include:  Solar panels on the maintenance facility;  All electrical vehicle for maintenance fleet;  Pollinator habitats and other wildlife conservation initiatives;  Native plant landscaping. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection The Envision certification provides verification of an inclusive, forward-thinking, and innovative process that prioritizes sustainability and resilience. Initial Planning INDOT and KYTC agreed to pursue an early version of the Project in 1997 based on the Ohio River Major Investment Study, the Metropolitan Louisville Ohio River Bridge Study, and assessments by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet and the Indiana Department of Transportation. Environmental Impact Assessment In accordance with the National Environmental Protection Act, the Project underwent an extensive impact assessment to evaluate alternatives and review physical, social, and biological effects of construction and operation. The Final Environmental Impact Statement (“FEIS”) was approved by the Federal Highway Administration in 2003 and a Supplemental FEIS was approved in 2012 after necessary changes to the Project were identified. BBGI Environmental Assessment BBGI’s own project selection strategy is guided by four key pillars, 1) Low-risk, 2) Globally diversified, 3) Strong ESG approach, and 4) Internally Managed. Assessment criteria consider environmental impacts, alignment with UN SDG’s, and climate models and factors including: earthquakes, flooding, and erosion. Business-as-usual scenario testing and risk assessment mapping are also considered. This additional environmental impact assessment from BBGI further confirms the Project’s sustainability performance. Stakeholder Involvement Project proponents intentionally engaged with the community during the design and construction phases and achieved nearly all points in the Envision framework related to community involvement. Project teams met regularly with community members and stakeholders, and collaborated on problem-solving. For example, the Project team preserved a significant historic and cultural resource, a landmark heritage home, by creating a tunnel to mitigate harmful impacts from construction. This commitment to outreach ensured the Project met regional needs while minimizing negative impacts to local communities. Long-lasting positive social impacts include economic development and job creation, in correlation with improved mobility. 4 The implementation of the solar compactors with the adjacent recycling container has resulted in significantly higher levels of recyclable collection than the project team originally anticipated. As of 2021, 75% of collected material has consisted of recyclable material.,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 5 Management of Proceeds Proceeds from the Series 2021 Bonds will solely be allocated to refunding the Series 2013A Bonds and to finance costs of issuance. Proceeds will be immediately loaned to the Company and allocated to refund the outstanding bonds upon closing. Proceeds will not be held in temporary investments. Reporting The Company intends to submit continuing disclosures to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) through the Indiana Finance Authority so long as the Series 2021 Bonds are outstanding. The Indiana Finance Authority will also provide reports in the event of material developments. This reporting will be done annually on the Electronic Municipal Market Access (“EMMA”) system operated by the MSRB. BBGI and VINCI prioritize transparency in operations and reporting. BBGI reports on alignment with the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, is required to meet the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulations, and will report using the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures for the first time in 2021. Consistent with these commitments to ESG transparency, VINCI and BBGI will produce a one-time voluntary update report confirming that proceeds were spent on the refunding. This report will be made publicly available on a project website within approximately one year of closing. The report will reaffirm conformance with Envision standards and will include project-specific scope 1 and 2 emissions beginning in January 2022, as well as information related to the continued operation of the Project. IMPACT AND ALIGNMENT WITH UN SDGS The Project supports the vision of the UN SDGs. Full text of the Targets for Goals 9, 11, and 17 can be found in Appendix A, with additional information available on the United Nations website: www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment By refinancing a project that reduced traffic congestion in Louisville, the Series 2021 Bonds advance Targets 11.2 and 11.6. Integration of the pedestrian and bike path f urther support Target 11.2. The extensive involvement of stakeholders in the risk assessment and design phases of the Project indicate alignment with Target 11.3. Target 9.4 is advanced by achieving an exceptional Envision Sustainable Infrastructure award. Multiple innovative technologies and features were integrated into the Project to support the objectives of Target 9.4. The successful public-private partnership and the Envision award made possible, in part, by the collaborative partnership supports Target 17.7.

Runoff controls are put in place to minimize contamination of groundwater and surface water. NW2.3 Prevent Surface and Groundwater Contamination 9 18 Superior: During the design stage, the location of equipment and facilities containing potentially polluting substances are located away from sensitive environments. Runoff interceptors and drainage channels are designed to accommodate pollutants in stormwater runoff or ice melt, potential spills, and leakage. Spill prevention and response plans are in place. During operation, methods to monitor and minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff or ice melt are used. Biodiversity NW3.1 Preserve Species Biodiversity 13 16 Conserving: The project team works with state and local agencies to identify existing habitats in or near the project site. During the course of the project, efforts are made to not only protect existing habitats, but also to upgrade them. Efforts are made to plant appropriate vegetation, improve and expand wildlife corridors, and link existing habitats. Projects can preserve portions of the site, which are contiguous to natural areas outside of the site, in an undisturbed condition; create new connections between areas of important habitat; or remove existing barriers to movement. NW3.2 Control Invasive Species 11 11 Restorative: Effective programs and actions established to eliminate existing invasive species from the project site. NW3.3 Restore Disturbed Soils 8 10 Conserving: Restore 100% of soils disturbed during construction in the site’s vegetated area. Soils must be reused for functions comparable to their original function (i.e., topsoil is used as topsoil, subsoil as subsoil, or subsoil is amended to become functional topsoil). NW3.4 Maintain Wetland and Surface Water Functions 19 19 Restorative: All four functions are maintained or enhanced and restored to have a fully functioning aquatic and riparian ecosystem.,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 13 Subcategory Credit Title & Identification Number Final ISI Assessment Total Possible Points Envision 2.0 Definition of Achievement of the Project NW0.0 Innovate or Exceed Credit Requirements 0 bonus - 93 203 Category: Climate & Risk Subcategory Credit Title & Identification Number Final ISI Assessment Total Possible Points Envision 2.0 Definition of Achievement of the Project Emission CR1.1 Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions 0 25 - CR1.2 Reduce Air Pollutant Emissions 0 15 - Resilience CR2.1 Assess Climate Threat 15 15 Conserving: A comprehensive climate impact assessment and adaptation plan has been developed. The plan should include the following components: Vulnerability assessment, Risk assessment, and Adaptation assessment. The process should include collaborations with the local emergency management department and meetings with the local community. CR2.2 Avoid Traps and Vulnerabilities 16 20 Conserving: Work with community decision makers and stakeholders to make a full and comprehensive assessment of resource demands and supplies, resource and infrastructure traps, and vulnerabilities. Use the assessment as a basis for making changes to the project design. Considerations include how the project contributes to the community’s assessment of resource demands and supplies, as well as resource and infrastructure traps, and vulnerabilities. CR2.3 Prepare For Long-Term Adaptability 16 20 Conserving: Plans and designs have been created and implemented to prepare for long-term climate change, including the effects of increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, water scarcity, sea level rise, extended droughts and heat waves, and increased ambient temperature. CR2.4 Prepare for Short-Term Hazards 17 21 Conserving: Plans and designs have been created and implemented to prepare for short-term hazards that have a 1- in-100-year or better chance of occurring, including direct and indirect impacts. Designs may limit the hazard itself, fortify against the hazard, or allow the project to adapt to the hazard. CR2.5 Manage Heat Island Effects 6 6 Conserving: At least 90% of hardscape surfaces meet shading or SRI requirements of 29 or higher.
