Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Marui Group ’s green bond framework : • Use of Proceeds: o The eligible categories (i) S ource 100% of electricity from renewable power sources , (ii) R eduction of GHG emissions and (iii) R enewable power generation are aligned with the eligible categories for renewable energy and energy efficiency recognized by the Green Bond Principles. o Sustainalytics recognizes that the purchase of renewable energy is operational expenditure not direc tly connected with any eligible CAPEX. As such, this use of proceeds has limited additionality. Given the context of the M ARUI G ROUP ’s business model, and it’s target to s ource 100% of its electricity from renewable power sources, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that facilitating the purchase and use of renewable energy will still have impact. o Under the energy efficiency category, Marui Group Co.,Ltd. is committed to allo cating the proceeds into projects that achieve 30% - 50% reduction in M ARUI G ROUP ’s power consumption. Sustainalytics positively views these thresholds which are considered in line with best practice . • Project Selection Process: o Marui Group Co.,Ltd. ’s internal process of evaluating and selecting projects is aligned with market practice. The selection is conducted by members of the Corporate Planning Department, the Sustainability Department the Finance Department, the Corporate Planning Department, the ESG Promotion Department, the Finance Department t and, a Marui Group Co.,Ltd. ’s consolidated subsidiary, MARUI FACILITIES Co.,Ltd.'s Management Department. . Final selection is made by Marui Group Co.,Ltd. ’s C ompliance Promotion B oard and the CSR Promotion Committee, which are chaired by the Marui Group Co.,Ltd 's P resident, and the officer in charge of S ustainability P romotion . o Sustainalytics acknowledges that this C - level management involvement is in line with market best practice. • Management of Proceeds: o Marui Group Co.,Ltd. ’s processes for management of proceeds is aligned with market standards, including systems to track the use of proceeds. Unallocated proceeds will be invested in cash or cash equivalents until allocation. • Reporting: o Marui Group Co.,Ltd. committed to report on an annual basis on the allocation for proceeds, including third part verification, which is aligned with best practice . o Impact reporting is conducted on an annual basis including indicators such as r atio of renewable power to the g roup’s total power consumption (%), rate of reduction of the group - wide total GHG emissions in comparison to the level in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 (%), amount of renewable power generation (kWh). Sustainalytics considers the impact indicators to be aligned with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that the Marui Group G reen B ond Framework aligns to the four core component s o f the Green Bond Principles 2018 . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 1 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form.,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Marui Group Green Bond 8 Section 2: Sustainability Performance of the Marui Group Contribution of framework to Marui Group ’s sustainability strategy and targets MARUI GROUP considers environmental impact management and responsible procurement as material to its business, with ecological inclusion, i.e. advanc ing eco - friendly business activities and prevent ing climate change, as one of its four core sustainability themes . 10 The g roup ’s promotion of sustainability is led by the Environment CSR Promotion Committee, which is chaired by a managing executive officer, indicating the importance of sustainability in the group . 11 Within its Environmental Policy, 12 the group com mits to reduc ing the environmental footprint of its stores and private brand products, and to provide innovative services that lower the group ’s impact on the environment. Furthermore, M ARUI GROUP has set science based GHG emission reduction target s to achieve a reduction in total GHG emissions from Scope 1 and Scope 2 of 40% and 80% by 2030 and 2050 having 2017 as a base year. 13 In addition, the group aims to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 35% by 2030. To achieve these goals, the group has implemented e nergy and resource conservation initiatives across the group , such as reducing energy consumption, GHG emissions, water and packaging, and promoting eff icient water resource utilization and renewable energy. 14 M ARUI GROUP also reports on its progress o n pre vious en vironmental goals, such as achieving reduction target of GHG emissions per unit by more than 1% and achieving a recycling rate target of 60% since the Environmental Policy was created in 2008 . 15 Given M ARUI GROUP ’s sustainability strategy, executive responsibility for sustainability, as well as M ARUI GROUP ’s ambitious sustainability targets and progress reporting, Sustainalytics is of the view that Marui Group Co.,Ltd. is well positioned to issue green bonds and t hat its green bonds will further support the group in advanc ing its sustainability strategy. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects Based on the use of proceeds, the main environmental and social risks are related to occupational health and safety of workers and to the environmental impact of largescale renewable energy infrastructure. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Marui Group Co.,Ltd. is well positioned to mitigate environmental and social risk s related to the use of proceeds as follow: • The financed r enewable energy project s are relatively small and at the g roup ’s facility sites , which limits risk related to biodiversity loss associated with large scale renewable energy projects and infrastructure . In addition, while MARUI GROUP identified potential environmental and social risks associated with the renewable energy project s to be funded through green bonds, the group takes ne ighbouring residents and landscape value near renewable energy sites into consideration for project development and that it ensures that the projects are in compliance with the laws and regulations related to environmental conservation outlined in the Guid elines for Business Plans. • MARUI GROU P in its human right policy 16 commits to adhere to the International Bill of Human Rights and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and has a dedicated occupational health and safety management programme and committee chaired by an executive officer of Marui Group Co.,Ltd. , 17 indicating that MARUI GROUP has systems in place to prevent occupational health and safety risks. 10 MARUI GROUP Co - Creation Sustainability Report 2 017, p. 40, http://www.0101maruigroup.co.jp/en/sustainability/pdf/s_report/2017/s_report2017_ena4.pdf 11 MARUI GROUP , Corporate Governance, corporate website: http://www.0101maruigroup.co.jp/en/ci/governance.html 12 MARUI GROUP Sustainability, http://www.010 1maruigroup.co.jp/en/sustainability/theme03/environment_01.html 13 MARUI GROUP Sustainability, http://www.0101maruigroup.co.jp/en/sustainability/theme03/environment_01.html 14 MARUI GROUP Sustainability, http://www.0101maruigroup.co.jp/en/sustainability/theme03/environment_04.html 15 MARUI GROUP Sustainability, http://www.0101maruigroup.co.jp/en/sustainability/theme03/environment_01.html 16 Marui corporate website: http://www.0101maruigroup.co.jp/en/sustaina bility/overview/index.html#overview2 17 Marui corporate website: http://www.0101maruigroup.co.jp/en/sustainability/theme02/health.html#health3_0,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Marui Group Green Bond 9 Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds The use of proceeds for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency are recognized as impactful by GBP , particularly in the Japanese local context. Importance of renewable energy and energy efficiency Prior to the Fukushima - Dai i chi nuclear disaster in 2011, nuclear energy accounted for almost 30% of Japan’s total electricity production. 18 However, as a result of the nuclear disaster Japan shut down all of its nuclear power plants, with 9 of the 42 operable reactors reopen ing since then . 19 The shut - down significantly reduced the country’s energy - generating capacity and increased the use of oil, coal and natural gas. As Japan committed to a 26% and 18% carbon reduction in 2030 compared to 2013 and 1990 levels respectively, 20 increasing renewa ble energy supply and improving energy efficiency is important to achiev ing its GHG reduction target. In addition, renewable energy production also contributes to the country’s new energy plan for 2030, 21 which aims to reduce nuclear power use from 28% of the 2010 level to 20 – 22% in 2030 while increasing renewable energy (wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and hydro) 1 0 % to 22 – 24%. 22 Thus, Sustainalytics considers the use and development of renewable en ergy to be impactful and contributing to Japan ’s G HG reduction targets. In addition, Sustainalytics view s positively Marui Group Co.,Ltd. ’s commitments on purchasing renewable energy such as solar and wind energy . Regarding e nergy efficiency , measures that decrease the use of energy in general decreases dependency on fossil fuel - based sources . In Japan, the energy consumption of commercial buildings has increased in recent years as a result of increased square footage . Overall, t he building sector accou nts for one third of total energy use in Japan, 23 indicating the importance of measures to increase energy efficient buildings, as manifested in the Building Energy Efficiency Act in 8 July 2015. 24 D ata from 2009 indicate that air conditioning accounts for 5 0% of the energy demand of office buildings, lighting and office equipment for 30% and elevators for 20%. 25 Given the importance of renewable energy and energy efficiency in Japan , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the use of proceeds in these categories is impactful and contributes to meeting Japan’s GHG emission targets. 18 Nuclear Power in Japan, World Nuclear Association; http://www.world - nuclear.org/information - library/country - pr ofiles/countries - g - n/japan - nuclear - power.aspx 19 World Nuclear Association: Nuclear Power in Japan, updated July 2018: http://world - nuclear.org/information - library/country - profiles/countries - g - n/japan - nuclear - power.aspx 20 Japan, Climate Action Tracker: htt ps://climateactiontracker.org/countries/japan/ 21 Long - term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry: http://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2015/pdf/0716_01a.pdf 22 Japan’s Energy, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry Agenc y for Natural Resources and Energy: http://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/en/category/brochures/pdf/japan_energy_2016.pdf 23 Overview of the Building Energy Efficiency Act (Japanese), Ministry of Land Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan; http://www.mlit.go. jp/common/001178846.pdf 24 The act provides regulatory measures to ensure compliance with energy efficiency standards for large - scale non - residential buildings, and encourages the use of green building certification systems, such as CASBEE.
