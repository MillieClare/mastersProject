© Sustainalytics 201 9 Second - Party Opinion CAF G reen Bond Framework Evaluation Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the CAF Green Bond Framework i s credible and impactful and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018. This assessment is based on the following: The eligible category for the use of proceeds (i) Renewable energy, (ii) Clean transportation, (iii) Sustainable management of living natural resources and land use, (iv) Waste management, (v) Water management, (vi) Energy efficiency are aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond Pri nciples 2018. Sustainalytics considers that th e eligible projects will contribute to a reduction in the environmental footprint in the countries where CAF operates and issues loans. In addition, Sustainalytics views that the projects will advance UN SDG 6, 7, 11, 14, and 15 . CAF’s process for project evaluation and selection is executed through a dedicated Green Bond Program Team with cross - departmental representation from key areas of the bank such as international bond issuances and climate change, strategic planning, treasury and business project executives. This process is in line with market practices. CAF has an internal process to monitor and track individual projects composing CAF’s Green Bond portfolio. Pending full allocation, CAF will track and maintain its una llocated proceeds in the company’s general liquidity portfolio and invest them in high grade short - term liquid assets in line with the bank’s liquidity and treasury policy. This process is aligned with market practices. CAF committed to disclose annual allocation and impact reporting. The (i) allocation reporting will include loan information, allocated amounts to projects or portions allocated. The (ii) impact report will include relevant KPIs tailored for each Eligible Green Project Categor y . Sustainalytics views the scope and granularity of CAF’s reporting to be in line with market practices.

CAF has offices in Buenos Aires, La Paz, Brasilia, Bogotá , Asuncion , Lima, Madrid, Mexico City, Montevideo , Panama City, Port of Spain and Quito . CAF was founded on 19 68 and is headquartered in Caracas, Venezuela. CAF h as developed th e CAF Green Bond Framework (the “ F ramework ”) under which it intends to issue green bon ds and use the proceeds to finance and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and/or future projects targeting the reduction of GHG emissions, climate resilience and adaptation, the efficien t use of resources and ecological services . The F ramework defines eligibility criteria i n six areas: 1. Renewable energy 2. Clean transportation 3. Sustainable management of living natural resources and land use 4. Waste management 5. Water management 6. Energy efficiency CAF e ngaged Sustainalytics to review the CAF Green Bond Framework, dated April 2019, and provide a second - party opinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) . 1 This F ramework ha s been published in a separate document . 2 As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of CAF’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of CAF’s green bond s . Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - p ublic information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of th e CAF Green Bond Framework and should be read in conjunction with th at F ramework. 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ 2 The CAF Green Bond Framework is available on CA F ’s webs ite at: https://www.caf.com/en/investors/,Second - Party Opinion CAF Green Bond Framework 3 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on th e CAF Green Bond Framework Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the CAF Green Bond Framework i s credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 201 8 . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of the CAF Green Bond F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The six use of proc eeds categories of the CAF Green Bond Framework are recognized by the Green Bond Principles 2018 as project categories with positive environmental benefits. For additional information on impact, consult Section 3. - Eligi ble renewable energy projects are defined as wind, solar, small - scale hydro (<20MW installed capacity), biomass , ocean power and wholly dedicated transmission systems for renewable energy. Sustainalytics views favorably that only biomass projects with dire ct emissions of less than 100g CO 2 /kWh are included and that feedstocks will be limited those that do not deplete existing terrestrial carbon pools, do not compete with food production, and are not grown in areas of high biodiversity . - The sustainable management of living natural resources and land use criteria makes reference to credible third - party standards, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), Rainforest Alliance, UTZ, Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) , the Intercultural Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) , Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) , and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). While some of the se third - party certification schemes have received criticism related to the implementation and control of standards, Sustainalytics considers the schemes to be credible and impactful. See Appendix 1 and 2 for additional detail on the third - party standards. • Project Evalu ation and Selection: - CAF has a project evaluation and selection process which is executed through a dedicated Green Bond Program team headed by the Vice President of Finance. The team will have cross departmental representation from various functional are as of the bank such as international bond issuances and climate change, strategic planning, treasury and business project executives . Sustainalytics assesses this process to be aligned with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - CAF implemented a Portfol io Monitoring Policy through which it will monitor and track individual projects composing the bank’s g reen b ond portfolio. Pending full allocation, CAF will track and maintain its unallocated proceeds in the company’s general liquidity portfolio and inves t them in high grade short - term liquid assets in line with the bank’s liquidity and treasury policy. Sustainalytics views this process to be aligned with market practice. • Reporting: - CAF confirmed that it will publish annual allocation and impact reporting. 3 The (i) allocation reporting will cover relevant transaction information such as loan information, allocated amounts and portions financed. The (ii) impact report will cover impact metrics dedicated per each Eligible Green Project category such as annual GHG emissions savings (in tCO 2e ), renewable energy capacity built or rehabilitated (in MW ), minimum energy efficiency improvement achieved (%), and c ertification achieved for sustainable management of living natural resources and land use . Susta inalytics views the scope and granularity of CAF’s allocation and impact reporting to be in line with current market practices. 3 The allocation and impact reporting will be made available on CAF’s website at: https://www.caf.com/en/investors/,Second - Party Opinion CAF Green Bond Framework 4 Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 S ustainalytics has determined that CAF’s g reen b ond aligns to the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 201 8 . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 3 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Strategy and Performance of the Issuer Contribution of framework to is suer’s sustainabi lity strategy Sustainalytics considers that CAF has a strong sustainability strategy and effective sustainability governance structures due to the following reasons: • CAF is a multilateral financial institution with a clear mission to support the sustainable development of its shareholder countries 4 and the integration of Latin America . • CAF’s management policies are structured around socia l, environmental and climate change considerations . Sustainalytics highligh ts that CAF has dedicated policy - based loans targeting programs, projects and action promoting green infrastructure and transition ing towards a low - carbon economy . Such policy - based loans have provided sovereign beneficiaries the opportunity to fund policy reforms or institutional changes related to the strengthening of their adaptive capacity and lower exposure to climate risks 5 or food security , 6 in addition to institutional and regulatory consolidation designed for climate change adaptation and mitigation . Considering the above, Sustainalytics believes that C AF ’s Framework is aligned with the bank ’s o verall mission and sustainability st rategy . Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the pr oceeds from the CAF Green Bond Framework will be directed towards Eligible Green Projects that are recognized as impactful under the Green Bond Principles 2018, Sustainalytics is aware that such projects may also lead to negative environmental and social o utcomes. Some key environmental and social risks associated with the eligible projects may include pollution control risks (dust, particulate, water and soil pollution or unintended discharges) in construction and infrastructure projects, risks related to social license to operate or fragile community involvement , biodiversity loss and others. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that CAF is able to mitigate such risks through internal regulations and sustainability structures set out by the bank’s Guidelines and Procedures on Environmental and Social Safeguards Manual 7 (the “manual”). The manual set out guidelines, requirements and instruments deemed necessary and sufficient to avoid, minimize, abate and offset any adverse impacts on people and the environme nt as part of the implementation of CAF funded projects. The manual also establishes nine key safeguard areas, namely (i) environmental and social impact assessment, (ii) natural habitats, (iii) involuntary resettlement, (iv) indigenous peoples, (v) pest m anagement, (vi) physical cultural resources, (vii) safety of dams, (viii) accountability and grievance system and (ix) gender mainstreaming. As part of the bank’s sustainability risk evaluation, all CAF funded projects undergo an environmental and social impact assessment segregating projects on a 3 - level risk scale (Category A , B or C) . 8 CAF has confirmed that p rojects that are classified as Category A are not eligible for the green bond program. CAF defines internal “Guideli nes and Procedures for Reviewing the Environment and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and Environment and Social Management Plan (ESMP)” , which is to be followed by a public consultation process with project - affected groups and all relevant stakeholders. 4 CAF’s shareholder countries are Argentina, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuado r, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, Venezuela and 13 other private banks in the Latin American region. 5 Support Program for Policies of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in Mexico was financed in the amount of USD 300 mill ion. 6 Support Program for Food Security Public Policy Management in Bolivia was financed in the amou nt of USD 70 million. 7 CAF’s Guidelines and Procedures on Environmental and Social S afeguards manual available at: https://www.caf.com/media/2759391/d0 - 7_s_e_safeguards_manual_to_caf - gef_projects_may_2015_28.pdf 8 Category A projects bear a high environmental and social impact potential, Category B projects bear a moderate environmental and social impact potential, wh ile Category C bear a low environmental and social impact potential.,Second - Party Opinion CAF Green Bond Framework 5 CAF has confirmed to Sustainalytics that pro ceeds from the green bonds will not be used to finance any countries / projects under the sanctioned list of the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). 9 Overall, Sustainalytics is confident that CAF is well positioned to issue green bonds and that the issuance of green bonds will help CAF fulfill its mission to support shareholder countries to their sustainable transformation a nd transition to low - carbon economy model. Moreover, given the structural due diligence performed on all CAF funded projects internally through the set - up Guidelines and Procedures on Environmental and Social Safeguards Manual, Sustainalytics considers that CAF is well positioned to identify and mi tigate environmental and social risks associated with its Eligible Green Project Categories. S ection 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All six u se of proceeds categories are recognized as impactful by the GBP. Sustainalytics has focused o n three below where the impact is specifically relevant in local context. Importan ce of clean transportation in Latin America Latin America has the fastest urbanization rate 10 in the world and is expected to maintain the trend leading to more than 90% of Latin Americans living in cities by 2050 . However, as an increasing number of people migrate from rural to urban areas , cities in the region struggle to provide adequate , sufficient and clean transportation infrastructure . Inadequate or scarce urban transportation infrastructure , originating mostly from rapid and unplanned urbanization, have led to extreme air pollution issues, with 81 million Latin Americans, or 26.5% of the urban residents, being currently exposed to air pollutant levels exceeding WHO guidelines. 11 Moreover, it is estimated that poor or inadequate transportation infrastructure in Latin America exacerbate s social inequalities mostly due to unequal access of vulnerable communities to mobility services and social, econ omic and professional opportunities, which in turn reinforce the barriers for social integration. 12 13 Studies concluded that Latin America’s current level of motorized private transportation is unsustainable and prescribed public policies oriented promoting a paradigm shift focusing on low - carbon and clean modes of transportation . 14 Sustainalytics considers that CAF’s financing of public and low carbon land transport such as electric rail, metros and tramways will have a direct positive impact on downscaling road influx and air pollution, in addition to entailing substantial benefits such as social inclusion and enhanced access to social, professional, economic or educational opportunities in Latin American cities. Impo rtance of sustainable waste managemen t in Latin America The United Nation s Environment Program 15 indicated that around a third of Latin America’s urban waste end s up in open dumpsites or directly into the biosphere , 16 while the current predictions suggest a wa ste generation increase of at least 25% by 2050. In this sense, the same studies demonstrated that 145,000 tones of waste are inadequately disposed every day in Latin American countries, while an other 35,000 tonnes per day remain uncollected, ultimately af fecting more than 40 million people. 17 Other studies have concluded that Latin America’s waste mismanagement originates from a series of perverse incentives making waste management un profitable. 18 Sustainalytics therefore, views positively CAF’s investments into new and modern waste management capacities, and strongly encourages the bank to select projects in local jurisdictions with sound waste incenti v es promoting the reduction, reuse and recyclin g of waste to ensure waste collection and treatment is impactful and sustainable . 9 The Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") - Sanctions Programs and I nformation of the US Department of the Treasury available at: https://www. treasury.gov/resource - center/sanctions/pages/default.aspx 10 Latin America’s cities are ready to take off.

Sustainalytics is of the opinion that CAF will play a contributing role to expand certified forest services in Latin America and provide a meaningful contribution to revert deforestation. Similarly, Sustainalytics considers that the financing of certifie d organic farming through the above - mentioned sustainable agriculture standards will provide strong environmental incentives for the expansion of forested areas across Latin American countries. Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030.

Conclusion CAF has Developed the CAF Green Bond Framework under which it intends to issue green bonds and use the proceeds to finance or refinance Eligible Green Projects relat ed to (i) Renewable E nergy, (ii) Clean T ransportation, (iii) Sustainable M anagement of L iving N atural R esource and L a nd U se, (iv) Waste M anagement, (v) Water M anagement and (vi) Energy E fficiency. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the use of third - party certification standards for projects related to the Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resource and Land Us e ensure the integration of environmental and social considerations and provide additional assurance that the company’s eligible projects will deliver meaningful positive impact. The use of proceeds categories specified in the Framework are aligned with those of the Green Bond Principles 2018 ; CAF has implemented a process by which all green bond proceeds will be tracked, allocated and managed, along with clear commitments for reporting on the allocation and KPIs tracking the environmental outcomes. Susta inalytics views that the investments funded by the green bonds will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Goals, in particular 6, 7, 11,14 , and 15 . Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that CAF is well - positioned to issue green bo nds, and that the CAF Green Bond Framework is credible, transparent, and in alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 .,Second - Party Opinion CAF Green Bond Framework 8 Appendices Appendix 1: Overview and Analysis of FSC and PEFC Certifications FSC and PEFC are both based on rigorous standards and on a multi - stakeholder structure. Both organizations are in line with international norms such as the International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In addition to compliance with laws in the country of certification, both schemes have a set of minimum requirements that companies are required to meet to obtain and maintain certifications. These requirements inc lude compliance with standards around sustainable management of forests, management of environmental impact of operations, preservation of biodiversity, management of socio - economic and community relations, and sourcing of sustainable wood (chain of custod y). Furthermore, both FSC and PEFC require external annual audits to ensure compliance and achieve and maintain certification. Despite these similarities, PEFC has faced certain criticisms from civil society actors. These are highlighted below: (i) Type of o rganization: Since the FSC is an international labelling and certification system, it sets its own global standards. The PEFC, in contrast, is not a standard setter, but a mutual recognition scheme. The PEFC sets sustainability benchmarks according to inte rnational norms and endorses national certification schemes that comply with these benchmarks. A common criticism of this model is that it allows for more flexibility in the interpretation of international PEFC benchmarks as per regional, cultural, and soc io - economic context, and results in the endorsement of less rigorous national certification schemes. However, the process for being endorsed by the PEFC is thorough; any national certification system seeking to obtain PEFC endorsement must submit to a comp rehensive assessment process, including independent evaluation and public consultation. This evaluation of compliance with international PEFC benchmarks is carried out by independent, accredited certification organizations. (ii) Indigenous People’s Rights: FSC and PEFC both identify indigenous rights as an important standard in forest management. Both certification schemes require that forest management activities consider and do not infringe on indigenous people’s rights, and the activities are carried out usi ng frameworks ensuring their free and informed consent. A criticism of PEFC is that it requires only engagement with indigenous people in forest management decisions, while the FSC provides performance - oriented targets, and requires forest managers operati ng on indigenous lands to obtain indigenous people’s consent through binding agreements. (iii) Sourcing wood from non - certified sources: Both FSC and the PEFC have established standards around sourcing wood from non - certified and controversial sources. FSC’s st andards direct forest managers to avoid wood harvested in violation of traditional and civil rights. A criticism of the comparable PEFC standard is that it limits identification of controversially sourced wood to situations where the local legislation is v iolated. However, PEFC standards explicitly reference the violation of local, national, and international legislation with regards to worker’s and indigenous people’s rights as being a controversial source of wood.,Second - Party Opinion CAF Green Bond Framework 9 Appendix 2: Overview and Assessment of Sustainable Forestry, Agriculture, Fishery and Aquaculture Rainforest Alliance UTZ Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials Intercultural Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements Marine Stewardship Council Aquaculture Stewardship Council Background The Rainforest Alliance Seal is a global certification system for Agriculture, Forestry and Tourism. The Rainforest Alliance certification indicates compliance with the organization’s standards for environmental, social and economic sustainability. Rainforest Alliance merged with UTZ in January 2018. The UTZ Label is a global certification system for coffee, cocoa, tea and hazelnuts. The UTZ certification incorporates environmental, social, farm management and farming pract ices considerations. UTZ merged with Rainforest Alliance in January 2018. The Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) is an international initiative that promotes and supports the sustainability of biomaterials production and processing, bringing t ogether companies, farmers, NGOs, and inter - governmental agencies. While the RSB was set up in 2007 as a means of ensuring the sustainability of liquid biofuels for transport, in 2013, it expanded its scope to include biomaterials. The Intercultural Federa tion of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) is an NGO that represents more than 160 - member organizations, including farmers, producers, traders, research and lobby organizations, environmental and consumer NGOs and companies. Its main purpose is to promo te knowledge, principles and practices about organic agriculture. The Family of Standards contains all standards endorsed as organic by the Organic Movement. Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is a non - profit organization founded in 1996, that issues eco - la bel certifications for fisheries which are sustainable and well - managed. The Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) is an independent, international NGO that manages the ASC certification and labelling program for responsible aquaculture. Clear positive impact Promoting sustainable practices in agriculture, forestry and tourism. Promoting sustainable practices in Coffee, Cocoa Tea and Hazelnut farming and trading. Promoting sustainable biomaterials. Promoting sustainable practices for organic agricultu re. Promoting sustainable fisheries practices. Promoting sustainable aquaculture practices. Minimum standards Rainforest alliance establishes a minimum threshold for impact through critical criteria, and requires farmers to go beyond by demonstrating imp roved sustainability on 14 continuous improvement criteria. UTZ establishes a minimum threshold for impact through mandatory points and additional points, and requires farmers to go beyond by demonstrating compliance with an increasingly large proportion o f both mandatory and additional points. The RSB sets minimum requirements in the areas of legality, planning, monitoring and continuous improvement, GHG emissions, human and labour rights, rural and social development, local food security, conservation, so il, water and air management, use of technology, inputs and management of waste, land rights and chain of custody. Each standard, which is a part of IFOAM, has its own set of minimum requirements. A minimum score must be met across each of the performance indicators. As a condition to certification, low - scoring indicators must be accompanied by action plans for improvement. Quantiative and qualitative thresholds which are designed to be measurable, metric - and performance - based. Certification may be granted with a “variance” to certain requirements of the standard. This variance is designed to allow the standard to adapt to local conditions, but has been criticized for weakening the standard and overriding the consultations,Second - Party Opinion CAF Green Bond Framework 10 involv ed in the standard - setting process. Scope of certification or programme Rainforest alliance addresses key risks such as human rights, child labour, pesticide use and biodiversity use through its criteria. UTZ addresses key risks such as human rights, chi ld labour, pesticide use and biodiversity use through its criteria. The RBS certification addresses key risks such as human and labour rights, supply chain, resource management, and land and biodiversity use through its criteria. The IFOAM standards addres ses different risk, including such as soil, pesticide, synthetic fertilizers and land use, through its criteria. The MSC standard consists of a fisheries standard and a chain of custody standard. The Fishery Standard assesse three core principles: sustain able fish stocks, minimising environmental impact, and effective fisheries management; collectively these account for the major environmental and social impacts. The Chain of Custody standard addresses certified spirchsing, product identification, seperat ion, traceability and records, and good management. ASC encompasses nine farm standards, covering 15 fish species as well as the harvest of seaweed. These farm standars lay out minimum requirements regarding both environmental and social performance. Add itionally, a Chain of Custody Standard is mandatory for all supply chain actors in order to ensure traceablity. Verification of standards and risk mitigation Certified entities undergo third party verification to ensure compliance with criteria and conti nuous improvement. Certified entities undergo third party verification to ensure compliance with criteria and continuous improvement. Certified entities undergo a self - assessment process and, afterward, receives a visit from a third - party auditor. Annual audits will also take place after the validation. Certified entities undergo third - party verification according to the specific IFOAM standard. Third - party conformity assessment bodies (CABs), certified by Accreditation Service International (ASI) carry ou t assessments in line with the MSC standard and ISO 17065. Certification is valid for up to five years.

Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainabilit y, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/o r environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference e xternal criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verifi cation. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognized external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceed s evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialized research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion CAF Green Bond Framework 18 Disclaimer © Sustainalytics 201 9 .
