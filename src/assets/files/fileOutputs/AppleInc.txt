(“Apple”, the “Company”, or the “Issuer”) designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and sells a variety of related services. Apple was founded in 1977 and is headquartered in Cupertino, California. In 2016 and 2017, Apple issued two green bonds to finance new and existing environmental projects across its global business divisions and operations that align with the C ompany’s environmental priorities. The f ramework s w ere created in line with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 20 15 and 2016, respectively . Apple has now created a new Green Bond Fra mework (the “Framework” or “Green Bond Framework ”) under which it intends to issue green bond s and use the proceeds to finance , in whole or in part, primarily new and some existing projects that Apple believes will reduce the carbon footprint associated with the company’s own operations and across its entire value chain, including manufacturing and product use . The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in the following five areas : 1. Low Carbon Design and Engineering 2. Energy Effic iency 3. Renewable Energy 4. Carbon Mitigation 5. Carbon Sequestration See Appendix 1 for a mapping of Apple ’s eligibility criteria to the categories of the Green Bond Principles . Apple engaged Sustainalytics to review the Framework , dated November 2019 , and provide a second - party opinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles ( 201 8 ) . 1 The F ramework will be published as the “Use of Proceeds” in the publicly filed prospectus supplement . As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Apple’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting a spects of the Framework . Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Apple Green Bond Framework and should be read in conjunction with th at F ramework. 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - soci al - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/,Second - Party Opinion Apple Green Bond Framework 3 Sustainal ytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Apple Green Bond Framework Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Apple Green Bond Framework is credible and im pactful, and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles ( 201 8 ) . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of the F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The five green categories for the use of proceeds are recognized as impactful by the Green Bond Principles ( 2018 ) . These five categories all relate to Apple’s objective to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its entire value chain. - Apple’s “ Low Carbon Design and Engineering ” category include s expenditures related to the procurement of lo w - carbon materials with an intent to reduc e product energy usage and/or increas e the use of recycled and low (embodied) carbon materials . Sustainalytics views favorably such efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of the company’s portfolio of products . Refer to Section 2 for a summary of Apple ’s sustainability efforts on material efficiency and Section 3 for the impact of Apple’s low - carbon initiatives . - The “ Energy Efficiency ” category includes expenditures related to projects at Apple and/or supply chain facilities . Potential projects include the installation of equipment such as sensors , controls and energy management systems ; as well as building design , commissioning and retrofits . For installation and optimization of equipment, Sustainalytics positively views Apple’s inten tion to pursue third - party verification for projects under this eligible category , as well as to report on energy efficiency improvements. - The “ Renewable Energy ” category considers direct investment , investment in renewable energy funds, and procurement of renewable energy , along with associated energy storage solutions . While Apple plans to focus primarily on solar and wind power projects, the Framework al lows for renewable energy investment s in other areas as well. In the event that Apple invests in renewable energy projects other than solar and wind power projects , Sustainalytics encourages the company to establish an emissions intensity threshold 2 and to ensure, in the case of any biomass or waste biomass - to - energy projects, that feedstock be sourced sustainably. - In the event Apple purchase s renewable energy credits , these would be directly tied to specific and identifiable new projects and purchased on an annual rather than one - time basis. This category also includes projects to advance market structures, regulation and policy. Sustainalytics notes positively training and capacity building initiatives so long as such initiatives are educatio nal, rather than political, in nature. - The “ Carbon Mitigation ” and “ Car bon Sequestration ” categories include e xpenditures related to (i) emissions abatement assessment and technologies ; (ii) low - carbon fuel sourcing ; 3 and ( iii ) carbon sequestration projects . 4 • Project Evaluation and Selection: - Apple’s Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives team will evaluate and select eligible projects , on an annual basis , in accordance with the company’s environmental planning process . Apple’s Vice President of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives will provide final approval of all projects . This is in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - Apple’s Fin ance department will track the net proceeds through an internal system. Pending allocation, the net proceeds may be temporarily invested in accordance with Apple’s investment portfolio or used to repay existing debt. This is line with market practice. • Rep orting: - Apple intends to publish a Green Bond Impact Report on its website, on an annual basis, until full allocation. The reporting will be accompanied with management’s assertion on the allocation of net proceeds and an examination report on such asserti on conducted by an 2 Sustainalytics regards a direct emissions threshold of less than 100g CO 2 /kWh as credible and aligned with international targets for GHG emissions reduction as well as with market practice. 3 Apple excludes all fossil fuels for the purpose of defining eligibility for sourcing low carbon fuels. 4 Apple has communicated to Sustainalytics that it will prioritize natural carbon sequestration projects where positive environ mental impacts can be qua ntified. In case of future allocations to such projects, the company aims to pursue third - party verification and reporting on impact under existing protocol or methodology, where feasible.,Second - Party Opinion Apple Green Bond Framework 4 independent registered public accounting firm . The report will also include a review from a second - party provider who will assess compliance with the Green Bond Framework. Sustainalytics considers this in line with market best practice. - The allocation reporting will include amounts allocated on a project - portfolio basis . - Th e impact reporting will include an estimate of total carbon savings aggregated from projects implemented that year . Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustaina lytics has determined that the Apple Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components of the Green Bond Principles ( 201 8 ) . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 2 : Green B ond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Performance of the Issuer Contribution of the F ramework to Apple ’s sustainability strategy Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Apple demonstrates a strong commitment to sustainability within its own operations and its supply chain with a focus on three key environmental areas: (i) addressing “climate change”, (ii) conserving “resources”, and (iii) utilizing “smarter chemistry” . Some example s of sustainability progress and initiatives, a s outlined in Apple’s Environmental Responsibility Report 2019 , 5 include : • GHG E missions Reduction : - In 2018, Apple achieved a 64% reduc tion in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from its direct operations , relative to a 2011 baseline, and a 35% reduction in the company’s overall footprint , compared to a 2015 baseline. - Apple calculates its emissions using a product lifecycle carbon assessment approach. This allows the C ompany to prioritize projects that reduce emissions f rom product manufacturing, use, and specific materials and components. - Apple partnered with aluminum manufacturers, such as Alcoa Corporation and Rio Tinto Aluminum, to commercialize technology that eliminates direct GHG emissions from conventional smelti ng process. The company, both of its partners, and the governments of Canada and Quebec, collectively planned to invest USD144 million in research and development related to carbon - free aluminum smelting. • Renewable Energy: - The company sources 100% renew able energy for the electricity used at its global facilities . As a non - energy company, Apple is one of the largest direct invest ors in renewable energy (over 600 MW as of April 2019 ). 5 Apple also seek s to procure renewable energy with rigorous measurement and tracking procedure s , and to use third - party registries and certification programs such as Green - e Energy. - Apple anno unced its Supplier Clean Energy Program in 2015, with an aim to make “world - class products with greener manufacturing.” The company is on track to exceed its 2020 goal of bringing online 4 GW of new clean energy in its supply chain, with 44 suppliers , as o f April 2019, committed to 100% renewable energy for Apple production . Additionally, Apple launched the China Clean Energy Fund to connect its suppliers with renewable energy sources and will be jointly investing nearly USD300 million between 2019 and 2022 . • Energy Efficiency: - Apple achieved a 70% reduction in average product energy consumption between 2009 - 2019 and saved 41.5 million kWh in fiscal year 2018 through energy efficiency initiatives at its global facilities. - In 2018, Apple’s 11 - inch iPad Pro models were reported to be approximately 69% more energy efficient than equivalent products certified by the ENERGY STAR standard. - After conduct ing a review of its carbon emissions , Apple found that integrated circuits contribute to a significant portion of its manufacturing carbon footprint as the process of transforming a silicon wafer into an integrated circuit is highly energy intensive. Through the process of design and re - engineered manufacturing, Apple was able to reduce the amount of silicon used in chips, without losing the quality of their performance, resulting in 160,000 metric tons of avoided CO 2 emissions reduction in 2018. 5 Apple, Environmental Responsibility Report - 2019 Progress Report : https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Responsibility_Report_2019.pdf,Second - Party Opinion Apple Green Bond Framework 5 • Material E fficiency and Circular Economy : - The C ompany promotes a circular supply chain and aims to one day make its products only from recycled and renewable materials in the future , in particular, by using aluminum, cobalt, tin, paper, and plastics from recycled or responsibly sourced bio - based feedstocks . B etween 2015 and 2018, Apple reduced its plastic use in its US product packaging by 48%, and in fiscal year 2018, the company used 50% recycled pap er and implemented a policy requiring virgin paper be sourced from responsibly managed forests, or Forest Stewardship Council ( FSC ) certified sources. In September 2019, Apple announced the use of recycled rare earth elements in a key component of its rece ntly launched iPhone devices (iPhone 11 , iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max ). 6 - Apple has reported that since 2015 the carbon footprint of aluminum enclosures of MacBook computers has steadily decreased, due to sourcing power from hydro - powered smelters, improved material efficiency of manufacturing processes , as well as an increase i n recycled content in its products. - The company has also lowered its environmental impact by using 100% recycled aluminum for the enclosure of a number of products, including the new MacBook Air with Retina display (released in October 2018), cutting the product’s carbon footprint in half. • Other Environmental I nitiatives: - Apple diverted 74% of its waste from landfill through recycling and composting in fiscal year 2018 and strives to pursue a goal of “ z ero w aste to l andfill ” at more than 450 corporate facilities, 500 retail stores, and five data centers. In 2018, the company also achieved UL Zero Waste certification 7 for 100% of final assembly sites for many of Apple’s major product lines (e.g. iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, and HomePod ) . 8 - Apple’s Clean Water Program promotes the installation of low - flow fixtures, use of water meters, and employee education to achieve water savings in its supply chain. In 2018, Apple’s suppliers had conserved approximately 21 billio n gallons of water since 2013 . Apple’s facilities used approximately 63 million gallons of recycled water, as well as captured and reused approximately 4 million gallons of rainwater in fiscal year 2018 for cooling, irrigation, and construction needs of a data center and corporate offices. - The company is constructing more than 12 million square feet of green building space globally and aiming for certification standard s such as LEED and BREEAM. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Apple Green Bond Framework is aligned with the company’s overall sustainability strategy and initiatives and will further the C ompany’s action on its key environmental priorities . Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the use of proceeds from the Framework will be directed towards e ligible projects that are recognized by the Green Bond Principles ( 2018 ) to have positive environmental impact, Sustainalytics is aware that such eligible p rojects could also lead to negative environmental and social outcomes. Some key environmental and social risks associated with the e ligible projects within Apple’s own operations an d within its value chain, could include lack of pollution control and occupational health and safety. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Apple is able to manage and/or mitigate potential risks through implementation of the following: • The Apple Chemical Management Program include s risk assessment and control procedures related to chemical exposures to supply chain employees. Apple also collects comprehensive chemical data for a significant proportion (by mass) of several flagship products and has implemented the Apple Regulated Substances Specification (RSS) 9 to evaluate supplier compliance on the restricted use of certain chemicals. Furthermore, the C ompany launched the Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program in 2016, which aimed at comprehensively understanding the chemical composition of all substances used to make Apple’s product parts so that less harmful alternatives could be substituted . • Apple’s suppliers must meet the Apple Supplier Responsibility S tandards 10 in order to comply with the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct . The Standards incorporate compliance with the requirements outlined 6 Reuters, Apple taps recycled rare earth elements for iPhone parts : https://www.reuters.com/article/us - apple - rareearths/apple - taps - recycled - rare - earth - elements - for - iphone - parts - idUSKBN1W31JG 7 The UL waste diversion validation program “focuses on monitorin g and measuring material flows that are not part of an organization’s final product ,” and offers claim validation to recognize companies that manage their waste in environmentally responsible ways.

The assessment s against the Apple Supplier Responsibility Standards include multi - day onsite visits followed by close partnership and capacity building to ensure implementation of all corrective actions. In 2018, a to tal of 770 assessments were completed at facilities, including manufacturing facilities , and logistics and repair centers , with an observed yearly increase of 30% in the number of high performers in the supply chain. • Apple also committed to responsible sourcing with identification of “Relevant Materials” in its products and associated due diligence management system – (i) risk identification, (ii) risk prevention and mitigation, (iii) third - party verifications or audit s of Supply Chain due diligence, and (iv) mechanism for reporting applicable risks – designed to conform in all material respects to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals from Conflict - Affected and High - Risk Areas (the “O ECD Guidance”) . In 2018, t he company’s Conflict Minerals Report 11 stated that 100% of Apple’s supply chain for all applicable products participated in an independent third - party conflict minerals audit program for tantalum, tin, and tungsten (3TG) and cobal t . • As a part of the OECD Guidance, Apple also utilized the Risk Readiness Assessment (RRA) 12 to identify and report on each supplier company’s risk readiness across number of different risk issue areas. In 2018, 85% of 3TG smelters and refiners and 100% of cobalt refiners completed the RRA. Based on these policies, standards and assessments , Sustainalytics is of the opinion tha t Apple has implemented sufficient measures and is well positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly as sociated with the eligible categories. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All five green categories for the use of proceeds are recognized as impactful by the Green Bond Principles ( 2018 ) . The importance of carbon reduction initiatives in Apple’s operations and its supply chain Traditionally, the technology sector has in cluded emission sources that generate significant amount s of GHG s in the manufacturing and supply chain for such products . Apple has taken a proactive approach towards integrating low - carbon practices at its own facilities , and its suppliers ’ facilities , including in manufacturing processes . As highlighted in its 201 9 Environmental Responsibility Report , 5 Apple tracks energy and carbon across five stages of its supply chain: (i) corporate facilities, (ii) product manufacturing, (iii) product use, (iv) product transportation, and (v) product end - of - life processing. As a result of Apple’s efforts towards implementing low carbon practices across its value chain, the Company has been able to reduce carbon emissions from its direct operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 64% from a 2011 baseline, and by 35% for the Company’s entire footprint, including its value chain, from a 2015 baseline . 5 The following projects that Apple has implemented , several of which are summarized in Section 2, provide a basis for the potential impact of projects that will be funded by proceeds from future bonds issued pursuant to this Green Bond Framework: • Apple sourc es 100% renewable energy for all the electricity used at its global facilities in 43 countries worldwide. Future projects include solar, wind and energy storage investments in corporate and supplier facilities. • In 2015, Apple launched the Supplier Clean Energy Program 13 in order to advance the use of clean energy across its entire supply chain and operations, and in 2019 the Company announced that 44 of its manufacturing partners in 16 countries have committed to 100% renewable energy for Apple production. Since its ince ption in 2015, the Suppler Clean Energy Program has secured 5.3 gigawatts of clean energy commitments, which once completed, will help avoid over 8.6 million metric tons of CO2e annually. • A fter discovering that integrated circuits contribute to a significa nt portion of its manufacturing carbon footprint as the process of transforming a silicon wafer into an integrated circuit is highly energy intensive , Apple re - engineered its manufacturing process and was subsequently able to reduce the amount of silicon u sed in chips, without losing the quality of their performance, resulting in 160,000 metric tons of avoided CO 2 emissions reduction in 2018. 11 Apple, Conflict Minerals Report : https://www.apple.com/supplier - responsibility/pdf/Apple - Conflict - Minerals - Report.pdf 12 Apple, Smelter and Refiner List: https://www.apple.com/ca/supplier - responsibility/pdf/Apple - Smelter - and - Refiner - List.pdf 13 Apple, Supplier Clean Energy: https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Supplier_Clean_Energy_Program_Update_April_2019.pdf,Second - Party Opinion Apple Green Bond Framework 7 • Apple is lowering its carbon emissions by sourcing recycled and renewable materials for its products. The company h as lowered its environmental impact by using 100% recycled aluminum for the enclosure of a number of products, including the new MacBook Air with Retina display (released in October 2018), cutting the product’s carbon footprint in half. • In the area of car bon sequestration, in 2018, Apple announced a conservation project in Colombia focused on protecting and restoring a 27,000 - acre mangrove forest. 14 The project is expected to sequester 1,0 0 0,000 metric tons of CO2 over its lifetime . Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Apple’s financing of low - carbon design and engineering , energy efficiency, carbon mitigation and carbon sequestration projects will significantly reduce carbon emissions across Apple’s value chain , leading to an overal l positive environmental impact. Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. Sustainalytics believes that bond s issued under this Green Bond Framework can be expected to advance following SDG goals and targets: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Low Carbon Design and Engineering 12.
