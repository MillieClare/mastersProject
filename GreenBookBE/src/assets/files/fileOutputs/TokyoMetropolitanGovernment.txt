C O M / E S G 3 o f 2 9 Overall Evaluation of the Green Bond Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) commissioned ISS ESG to assist with its fourth Green Bond by assessing three core elements to determine the sustainability quality of the Framework: 1. TMG’s Green Bond Framework – benchmarked against the International Capital Market Association's (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (GBPs). 2. The asset pool – whether the projects contributes positively to the UN SDGs and perform against ISS ESG’s issue-specific key performance indicators (KPIs) (See Annex 2). 3. Review and classification of Japan’s sustainability performance on the basis of the ISS ESG Country Rating.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sustainability Quality of the Issuer and Green Bond Asset Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 4 o f 2 9 ISS ESG ASSESSMENT SUMMARY 1 ISS ESG’s evaluation will remain valid until any modification to the Framework or addition of new assets into the asset pool by the issuer and as long as the Country Rating does not change (last modification on the 23.06.2020). ISS ESG underwent a controversy screening of the asset pool on the 25.06.2020. 2 Rank relative to industry group. 1 indicates a high relative ESG performance, while 10 indicates a low relative ESG performance. SPO SECTION SUMMARY EVALUATION 1 Part 1: Performance against the GBPs The issuer has defined a formal concept for its Green Bond F ramework regarding use of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the ICMA GBPs . Positive Part 2: Sustainability quality of the asset pool The overall sustainability quality of the asset pool in terms of sustainability benefits, risk avoidance and minimisation is good based upon the ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs. The KPIs contain a clear description of eligible asset categories that can be found at page 11. All assets of the asset pool are located in Japan, where legislative frameworks set minimum standards, which reduce environmental and social risks. Positive Part 3: Issuer sustainability performance Japan, the country which the issuer is part of, shows a good sustainability performance and has been given a rating of B - , which classifies it as Prime by the methodology of the ISS ESG Country Rating. It is rated 3 2 nd out of 124 countries as of 1 7 . 0 7 .20 20 . This equates to a high relative performance, with a Decile Rank 2 of 3 . Japan has not yet progressed into a greener economy, as the dependence on fossil fuels is still great, and the country’s climate record is correspondingly poor. However, economic efficiency is high, and the welfare state delivers a high level of social justice, good access to healthcare and favorable working conditions. Yet, the rising share of old people in the society, low levels of immigration and birthra tes are challenging that model of society already today. The country has strong institutions, uncritical levels of corruption and a clean human rights record, although societal discrimination is prevailing on some grounds. In the medium term, Japan could give up its post - World War II pacifism with regard to tensions in East Asia, entailing greater risks for its political stability.

The distribution of proceeds between project categories is well disclosed. 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection The project selection for the inclusion in the Green Bond is carried out by TMG. The local government must either consult the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and obtain its approval to issue municipal bonds or report to the Ministry before issuance. The selection process is based on the Criteria for Evaluation and Selection of Target Projects defined by TMG. Those criteria include environmental, social and governance aspects. CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION & SELECTION OF PROJECTS E1 Clear positive environmental impact E2 Reduction of negative environmental impact S1 Clear positive social impact S2 Reduction of negative social impact G1 Policy & regulatory compliance G2 Feasibility / urgency G3 Sustainable effect In principle, Local Governments may issue municipal bonds to finance purposes stipulated in Article 5 of the Local Government Finance Act.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sustainability Quality of the Issuer and Green Bond Asset Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 9 o f 2 9 Such purposes include: • Operating local public enterprises • Investments and loans • Refunding of existing municipal bonds • Emergency disaster control projects, disaster recovery projects, disaster-relief projects, and • Developing and constructing public infrastructure and facilities. Local Governments must consult with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and obtain approval for the issuance of bonds. However, the governments meeting a certain standard, can issue municipal bonds (such as publicly offering bonds) by reporting instead of the consultation. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the process for Project Evaluation and Selection broadly aligns with the GBPs. The environmental and social criteria for which the projects are selected are also clearly listed. The actors responsible for the selection of the assets are described. 3. Management of Proceeds As the annual expenditure in each fiscal year of the TMG needs to be assigned to its annual revenue 4 , in principle, Tokyo Green Bonds funds are appropriated for target projects within the fiscal year. The Bureau of Finance manages the execution status of target projects to follow up the allotment of Tokyo Green Bonds funds as necessary and discloses the allotment status based on the methods of information disclosure shown in the document. At the end of each fiscal year, as for all the revenue and expenditure including related to the projects funded by the TMG Bonds, the execution results and the settlement related documents will be created and submitted to the Tokyo Metropolitan Audit and Inspection Commissioners for examination. With the comments of the commissioners, the documents will be submitted to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly for certification. Use of Tokyo Green Bonds appropriated funds will be clarified by classifying the funds into the accounting division based on the TMG accounting system and by doing this, the funds will be managed. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the segregation and tracking of funds process aligns with the GBPs. However, the expected allocation period and temporary investments as well as the disclosure of portfolio balance of unallocated proceed could be added to align with best market practices. 4 This is based on the principle of a one-year budget, Article 208, Local Government Autonomy Act,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sustainability Quality of the Issuer and Green Bond Asset Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

Heat insulation on roads and pedestrian and cycling paths As a Use of Proceeds category, heat insulation on roads and pedestrian and cycling paths have a limited contribution to the SDG 13 “Climate action”. Additionally, when considering the deeper ESG management, heat insulation on roads and pedestrian and cycling paths can be associated to other SDGs. The table below presents the findings of an ISS ESG assessment of the assets (re-) financed against KPIs and the association with SDGs based on a mapping methodology.

Environmental aspects of construction ü According to TMG, all financed projects meet high environmental standards during the construction phase. ü For the financed projects, measures to effectively minimise the environmental impact during the construction phase are in place. Sustainable materials ü For all financed projects, measures for the use of sustainable construction materials are in place (e.g recycled/green asphalt, water retentive/heat insulating pavement). Working conditions during construction and maintenance work ü 100% of financed projects are located in Japan where high standards regarding labour rights (e.g. ILO core conventions) and health and safety are in place for construction and operational work conducted by own employees and contractors Controversy assessment A controversy assessment on the assets did not reveal any controversies that can be attributed to TMG. Impact indicators for the projects within this project category according to TMG* • Length of development in 1 out of 2 projects: 15.3km of cycling paths (by the end of FY2024) • Development area of heat insulating pavement in 1 out of 2 projects: 17.823km * ISS ESG does not provide impact calculations, nor checks the plausibility of the data provided by the issuer.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sustainability Quality of the Issuer and Green Bond Asset Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 2 2 o f 2 9 PART III: ASSESSMENT OF JAPAN’S ESG PERFORMANCE The ISS ESG Country Rating comprises a rating scale from A+ (excellent) to D- (poor). C O U N T R Y J A P A N S T A T U S P R I M E R A T I N G B - D E C I L E R A N K 3 This means that the country performed well in terms of sustainability, compared against other countries of the ISS ESG universe . In ISS ESG ’s view, the securities issued by the country therefore meet the basic requirements for sustainable investments. As of 17 .0 7 .20 20 , this rating places Japan 32 nd out of 124 countries rated by ISS ESG . The ISS ESG Country Rating evaluates the following eight areas in order to determine the sustainabili ty performance of a country: Social and Governance Performance § Social Rating § Political System and Governance § Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms § Social Conditions Environmental Performance § Environmental rating § Natural Resources § Climate Change and Energy § Production and Consumption I n the social part of the rating , Japan achieved a rating that was above average compared to other rated countries . In the environmental part, the country shows a below average performance compared to other rated countries, apart from the “ Production and Consumption ” area, where it slightly outperforms the other countries. Japan violates the exclusion criteria death pen alty, climate protection , coal power generation, and whaling screened by ISS ESG .

C O M / E S G 2 8 o f 2 9 ANNEX 2: Methodology ISS ESG Green KPIs The ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs serves as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality – i.e. the social and environmental added value – of the use of proceeds of TMG’s green bond. It comprises firstly the definition of the use of proceeds category offering added social and/or environmental value, and secondly the specific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the assets can be clearly identified and described. The sustainability criteria are complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measurement of the sustainability performance of the assets and which can also be used for reporting. Those indicators may be tailor-made to capture the context-specific environmental and social risks. To review the KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Federico Pezzolato (details below) who will send them directly to you. Asset evaluation methodology ISS ESG evaluates whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eligible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bond KPIs. All percentages refer to the amount of assets within one category (e.g. wind power). Additionally, the assessment “no or limited information is available” either indicates that no information was made available to ISS ESG or that the information provided did not fulfil the requirements of the ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs. The evaluation was carried out using information and documents provided to ISS ESG on a confidential basis by TMG’s (e.g. Due Diligence Reports). Further, national legislation and standards, depending on the asset location, were drawn on to complement the information provided by the issuer. Assessment of the contribution and association to the SDG The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed in September 2015 by the United Nations and provide a benchmark for key opportunities and challenges toward a more sustainable future. Using a proprietary method, ISS ESG identifies the extent to which TMG contributes to related SDGs.
