Our opinion is established according to V.E ’ s Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) exclusive assessment methodology and to the latest version of the voluntary guidelines of ICMA’s Green Bond Principles (“GBP”) - edited in June 20 21 . Our opinion is built on the review of the following components: • Issuance: we assessed the Framework, including the coherence between the Framework and the Issuer’s environmental commitments, the Bond’s potential contribution to sustainability and its ali gnment with the four core components of the GBP 20 21 . • Issuer 2 : we assessed the Issuer’s management of potential stakeholder related ESG controversies and its involvement in controversial activities 3 . Our sources of information are multichannel, combining data (i) gathered from public sources, press content providers and stakeholders, (ii) from V.E ’ s exclusive ESG rating database, and (iii) information provided from the Issuer, through documents . We carried out our due diligence assessment from August 12 th to 30 th , 202 1 . We consider that we were provided access to all documents and interviewees we solicited. To this purpose , we made reasonable efforts to verify the accuracy of all dat a used as part of the assessment . Type of External Reviews supporting t his Framework ☒ Pre - issuance Second Party Opinion ☒ Independent verification of impact reporting ☒ Independent verification of funds allocation ☐ Climate Bond Initiative Certification 1 The “Green Covered Bond” is to be considered as the bond to be potentially issued, subject to the discretion of the Issuer. The name “Green Covered Bond” has been decided by the Issuer: it does not imply any opinion from V.E. 2 Crédit Agricole SA, mother company of Crédit A gricole N ext B ank, is part of V.E rating universe - the last ESG rating was performed in 202 1 . In agreement with the Issuer, this Second Party Opinion does not include the 202 1 assessment of Crédit Agricole SA ESG performance. Crédit Agricole Next Bank is not part of our rating universe . 3 The 17 controversial activities screened by V.E are: Alcohol, Animal welfare, Cannabis, Chemicals of concern, Civilian firearms, Coal, Fossil Fuels industry, Unconventional oil and gas, Gambling, Genetic engineering, Human embryonic stem cells, High interest rate lending, Military, Nuclear Power, Porno graphy, Reproductive Medicine and Tobacco.,A u g u s t 2 0 2 1 Copyright V.E 2021 – Reproduction of this content (documents, graphs and images) in whole or in part are prohibited without the express written authorization of V.E and is protected by the provision of the French Intellectual Property Code. 5 COHERENCE V.E considers that the contemplated Bonds are coherent with Crédit Agricole N ext B ank ’s strategic sustainability priorities and sector issues and that they contribute to achieving the Issuer’s sustainability commitments. As the global economy’s largest sector by market capitalization, banks have great potential to support society’s transition to a low carbon and sustainable economy. Their action is key in the promotion of effective solutions for the development of sustaina ble finance products and services, and the minimization of the negative impact of their investments and activities on environment, people and society. In particular, the banking sector can effectively contribute to these challenges by integrating ESG facto rs in their financing operations and by mobilizing the resources needed to close the financial gap, estimated around USD 1.5 trillion per year, to meet the objective of the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature increase to below 2°C. In particular, b anks have a great potential in fostering the development of green building and of improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock. According to the Swiss Federal Office of Energy , the Swiss buildings stock consumes approximately 45 % of the total ener gy demand in Switzerland and accounts for about one third of Switzerland’s CO 2 emissions. To be i n line with the EU energy policies and to achieve the Paris climate agreement objectives, the Swiss Federal Council has decided to reduce net CO 2 emissions to zero by 2050 and has been developing and implementing the “Energy Strategy 2050” since 2011 . T he Swiss Federal Government and the cantons launched in 2010 a building program that aims to promote energy - efficient refurbishments of buildings as well as inves tments in renewable energy, waste heat recovery and the optimization of building services technology. Crédit Agricole S.A., ultimately Crédit Agricole Next Bank’s mother company, appears to acknowledge its role in proving solutions to promote and facilitate the transition to a low carbon and sustainable economy and has developed sustain able finance products and services to minimize its impact on climate change and society. The company is also a signatory of UN Global Compact, a member of Paris Finance for Tomorrow, and signatory of the Net Zero Banking Alliance. Crédit Agricole CIB is a co - founder of the GBP and the only European bank that took part in drafting them in 2013. Crédit Agricole CIB is also a signatory of the Equator Principles III, being the first French bank to sign the Equator Principles in 2003, the year of launching. Amun di is a signatory of the UNPRI and has joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. In 2009, the Group created a Sustainable Banking tea m to support and advise its main clients on their transactions involving social and environmental considerations and selected four of the fields of excellence selected by the Crédit Agricole Group: agriculture and food processing, housing, health and agein g population, and energy saving and the environment. The Bank also commits to integrating environmental issues in its lending and investment activities in 'FReD', the Group CSR policy rolled out in 15 Group entities, while Crédit Agricole CIB adopted secto r policies including for Construction Sector. ESG policy also applies to 100% of Amundi’s actively managed funds. In 2019 the Group has adopted a new group strategic plan “Ambition 2022” which targets, among other things, the objective of making “green fi nance” a key growth driver for the group by: - Committing all Group entities to a common climate strategy in line with the Paris Agreement; - Strengthening its commitment to finance energy transition by, among other things, doubling the size of the green loan portfolio to €13bn by 2022 and aligning its sectorial policies with the Paris Agreement; - Promoting clean and responsible investment policies.

E L I G I B L E C A T E G O R Y E X P E C T E D I M P A C T A N A L Y S I S Green Building ADVANCED According to the EU Commission, Buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of EU energy consumption and 36% of the greenhouse gas emissions. Buildings are therefore the single largest energy consumer in Europe . In addition, a ccording to the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, the Swiss buildings stock consumes appro ximately 45 % of the total energy demand in Switzerland and accounts for about one third of Switzerland’s CO 2 emissions. Eligible Asset s targeting a CECB A or B which are less than 10 - years old M inergie certificates (Minergie, Minergie - P or Minergie - A) issued after 1st January 2017 or built after 1st January 2016 ( in absence of energy certificates ) belong to the top 15% of the most energy efficient buildings in Switzerland and thus are considered to have a positive impact on relative energy c onsumption and is likely to reduce the overall absolute GHG emissions . OVERALL ASSESSMENT ADVANCED ESG Risks Identification and Management systems in place at project level The identification and management of the environmental and social risks associated with the Eligible Projects are considered robust . Since all assets associated to the Eligible Assets are located in Swi tzerland , Designated Country of the Equator Principle s, d eemed to have robust environmental and social governance, as well as legislation systems and institutional capacity designed to protect their people and the natural environment, the Issuer relies on national legislation for specific risks and on releva nt documentation (e.g. construction and exploitation permits, technical and legal reviews) to demonstrate the respect of this legislation. Crédit Agricole N ext B ank , as part of Crédit Agricole Group, has set up a structured process to ensure the appropriate identification, classification and assessment of the environmental and social risks of all its transactions and clients. In addition, it has committed that all th e Eligible Assets shall comply with Crédit Agricole standard credit process, including compliance with the Equator Principles (EPs), with the Group’s CSR policy and dedicated sector policies, as well as to any a pplicable regulatory environmental and social requirements.,A u g u s t 2 0 2 1 Copyright V.E 2021 – Reproduction of this content (documents, graphs and images) in whole or in part are prohibited without the express written authorization of V.E and is protected by the provision of the French Intellectual Property Code. 14 V.E note s that an ambitious Real Estate CSR Pact 6 has been developed by the Issuer at Group level, with robust E&S standards covering all the material ESG risks associated to the assets (based on applying regulation, 2013 Equator Principles or IFC’s Performance Standards, as well as on the Ramsar convent ion, UNESCO heritage list and the SEVESO EU directive). However, V.E have no visibility on the effective application of this group's policies to the loans eligible for the Bonds. Regarding the borrowers (of the loans), a KYC process is in place, covering t he most material compliance and law r isks (corruption, money laundering, etc.). Regarding the financed assets linked to Eligible Assets , the information collected by the account managers does cover the provision of required authorisation and legal document ation by the client, however regarding E&S risks the Issuer o nly collect information to assess the compliance with the eligibility criteria ( CECB ’s building certificate, Minergies’energy efficiency and living comfort norms, Swiss sustainable Construction Network’s standard, 2000 Watts area’s standard ). No other E&S aspect is formally assessed nor considered by the Issuer. As regards responsible relation with the clients the Issuer has imp lemented a complete process for information, complaints management, amicable settlements. The Issuer has implemented a complete process to anticipate cases of default of payment (by assessing client before the loan acceptation) and to support clients facin g economic difficulties . 6 Real Estate CSR Pact,A u g u s t 2 0 2 1 Copyright V.E 2021 – Reproduction of this content (documents, graphs and images) in whole or in part are prohibited without the express written authorization of V.E and is protected by the provision of the French Intellectual Property Code. 15 ISSUER Management of ESG Controversies As of today, the review conducted by V.E did not reveal any ESG controversy against C rédit Agric o le N ext B ank over the last four years. Involvement in Controversial Activities The Issuer appear s to be not involved in any of the 17 controversial activities screened under our methodology, namely: Alcohol, Animal welfare, Cannabis, Chemicals of concern, Civilian firearms, Coal, Fossil Fuels industry, Unconventional oil and gas, Gamblin g, Genetic engineering, Human embryonic stem cells, High interest rate lending, Military, Nuclear Power, Pornography, Reproductive Medicine and Tobacco. The controversial activities research provides screening of companies to identify involvement in busine ss activities that are subject to philosophical or moral beliefs. The information does not suggest any approval or disapproval on their content from V.E .,A u g u s t 2 0 2 1 Copyright V.E 2021 – Reproduction of this content (documents, graphs and images) in whole or in part are prohibited without the express written authorization of V.E and is protected by the provision of the French Intellectual Property Code. 16 METHODOLOGY In V .E ’ s view, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors are intertwined and complementary. As such they cannot be separated in the assessment of ESG management in any organisation, activity or transaction. In this sense, V.E provides an opinion on the Is suer’s ESG performance as an organisation, and on the processes and commitments applicable to the intended issuance. Our Second Party Opinions (SPOs) are subject to internal quality control at three levels ( Analyst, Project Manage r and Quality Reviewer ). If necessary, this process is complemented by a final review and validation by the Expertise Committee and Supervisor. A right of complaint and recourse is guaranteed to all companies under our review, following three levels: first, the team in contact wi t h the company; then the Executive Director in charge of Methods, Innovation & Quality; and finally, V .E ’ s Scientific Council. COHERENCE S c a l e o f a s s e s s m e n t : n o t c o h e r e n t , p a r t ia l l y c o h e r e n t , c o h e r e n t This section analyses whether the activity to be financed through the selected instrument is coherent with the Issuer's sustainability priorities and strategy, and whether it responds to the main sustainability issues of the sector where the Issuer operates. ISSUANCE Alignment with the Green Bond Princi ples S c a l e o f a s s e s s m e n t : N o t a l i g n e d , P a r t i a l l y a l ig n e d , A l ig n e d , B e s t P r a c t i c e s The Framework has been evaluated by V.E according to the ICMA’s Green Bond Principles - June 20 21 (“GBP”), and on our methodology based on international standards and sector guidelines applicable in terms of ESG management and assessment. Use of proceeds The definition of the Eligible Projects and their sustainable objectives and benefits are a core element of Green/Social/Sust ainable Bonds and Loans standards. V.E evaluates the clarity of the definition of the Eligible Categories, as well as the definition and the relevance of the primary sustainability objectives. We evaluate the descriptions of the expected benefits in terms of relevan ce, measurability and quanti fication. In addition, we map the potential contribution of Eligible Projects to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals’ targets. Process for evaluation and selection The evaluation and selection process is assessed by V.E on its transparency, go vernance and relevance.

Expected positive impact of the activities on environmental and/or social objectives The expected positive impact of activities on environmental and/or social objectives to be financed by the Issuer or Borrower is assessed on the basis of: i) the relevance of the activity to respond to an important environmental objective for the sector of the activity; or to respond to an important social need at country level; 7 ii) the scope of the impact: the extent to which the expected impacts are reaching r elevant stakeholders (i.e. the issuer, its value chain, local and global stakeholders); or targeting those populations most in need; iii) the magnitude and durability of the potential impact of the proposed activity on the environmental and/or social objec tives (capacity to not just reduce, but to prevent/avoid negative impact; or to provide a structural/long - term improvement); iv) only for environmental objectives, the extent to which the activity is adopting the best available option. ESG risk management for eligible activities The identification and management of the potential ESG risks associated with the eligible projects/activities are analysed on the basis of V .E ’ s ESG assessment methodology, international standards and sector guidelines ap plicable in terms of ESG management and assessment. ISSUER Management of stakeholder - related ESG controversies V.E defines a controversy as public information or contradictory opinions from reliable 8 sources that incriminate or make allegations against an issuer regarding how it handles ESG issues as defined in V.E ESG framework. Each controversy may relate to several facts or events, to their conflicting interpretations, legal procedures or non - prove n claims. V.E reviewed information provided by the Issuer, press content providers and stakeholders (partnership with Factiva Dow Jones: ac cess to the content of 28,500 publications worldwide from reference financial newspapers to sector - focused magazines, local publications or Non - Government Organizations). Information gathered from these sources is considered as long as it is public, documented and traceable. V.E provides an opinion on companies’ controversies risks mitigation based on the analysis of 3 factors: - Frequency : reflects for each ESG challenge the number of controversies that the Issuer has faced. At corporate level, this factor reflects on the overall number of controversies that the Issuer has faced and the scope of ESG issues impacted (scale: Isolated, Occasional, Frequent, Persistent). - Severity : the more a controversy is related to stakeholders’ fundamental interests, proves actual corporate respons ibility in its occurrence, and have caused adverse impacts for stakeholders and the company, the higher its severity is. Severity assigned 7 The importance of a specific social need at country level is assessed on the basis of the country performance on the priority SDG that the project is targeting using data from Sachs, J., Schmidt - Traub, G., Kro ll, C., Lafortune, G., Fuller, G., Woelm, F. 2020. The Sustainable Development Goals and COVID - 19. Sustainable Development Report 2020. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 8 ‘Reliable’ means that there are sufficient details to substantiate claims made, with due attention paid to the political dime nsion of news and the danger of misinformation. V.E draws on investigative journalism, the business press, NGO and trade union repo rts which focus on corporate behavior relating to ESG issues. It is neither possible nor advisable to create a prescriptive fixed list of sources as new, valid sources aris e all the time and it is necessary to investigate these as and when they are retriev ed in order to comprehensively cover evolving issues and media.,A u g u s t 2 0 2 1 Copyright V.E 2021 – Reproduction of this content (documents, graphs and images) in whole or in part are prohibited without the express written authorization of V.E and is protected by the provision of the French Intellectual Property Code. 18 at the corporate level will reflect the highest severity of all cases faced by the company (scale: Minor, Significant , High, Critical). - Responsiveness : ability demonstrated by an Issuer to dialogue with its stakeholders in a risk management perspective and based on explanatory, preventative, remediating or corrective measures. At corporate level, this factor will reflect the overall responsiveness of the company for all cases faced (scale: Proactive, Remediate, Reactive, Non - Communicative). The impact of a controversy on a company's reputation reduces with time, depending on the severity of the event and the compa ny's re sponsiveness to this event. Conventionally, V .E ' s controversy database covers any controversy with Minor or Significant severity during 24 months after the last event registered and during 48 months for High and Critical controversies. Involvement in contr oversial activities 17 controversial activities have been analysed following 30 parameters to screen the company's involvement in any of them. Th e company's level of involvement (Major, Minor, No) in a controversial activity is based on: - An estimation of the revenues derived from controversial products or services. - The specific nature of the controversial products or services provided by the company.
