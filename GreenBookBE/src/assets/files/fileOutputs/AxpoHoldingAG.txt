C O M / E S G 3 o f 2 0 Overall Evaluation of the Green Bond Axpo Holding AG (Axpo ) commissioned ISS ESG to assist with its Green Bond by assessing three core elements to determine the sustainability quality of the instrument : 1. Axpo ’s Green Bond Framework – benchmarked against the International Capital Market Association's (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (GBPs ). 2. The asset pool – whether the projects aligned with ISS ESG ’s issue - specific key performance indicators (KPIs) (See Annex 2 ). 3. Axpo’s sustainability performance, according to the ISS ESG C orporate R ating. ISS ESG ASSESSMENT SUMMARY 1 The ISS ESG ’s present ev aluation will remain valid until any modification of the Green Bond Framework (version from June 2020) or addition of new assets into the asset pool by the issuer and as long as the Corporate Rating does not change (last modificati on on the 06 .0 2 .20 20 ). IS S ESG underwent a controversy screening of the asset pool on the 2 4 .06.2020. 2 Rank relative to industry group. 1 indicates a high relative ESG performance, while 10 indicates a low relative ESG performan ce. SPO SECTION SUMMARY EVALUATION 1 Part 1: Performance against G BPs The issuer has defined a formal concept for its Green Bond regarding use of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the ICMA G BPs. Positive Part 2: Sustainability quality of the green asset pool The overall sustainability quality of the asset pool in terms of sustainability benefit s, risk avoidance and minimisation is good based upon the ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs. The Green Bond KPIs contain a clear description of the financed asset categor ies which includ e s olar and wind power. All assets of the asset pool are located in France, Spain and Italy, highly regulated and developed countr ies . Legislative frameworks in th ese countr ies set minimum standards, which reduce environmental and social risks. Positive Part 3: Issuer sustainability performance The issuer itself shows a medium sustainability performance and has been given a rating of ‘ C + ’ , which classifies it as ‘ Not Prime’ by t he methodology of the ISS ESG Corporate Rating. It is rated 18 th out of 12 5 compan ies within its sector as of 0 7 .0 7 .2020 . This equates to a good relative performance, with a Decile Rank 2 of 2 .

C O M / E S G 4 o f 2 0 Contribution of the Green Bond to the UN SDGs Based on the assessment of the sustainability quality of the Green Bond asset pool and using a proprietary methodology, ISS ESG assessed the contribution of the Axpo’s Green B ond to the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations (UN SDGs). This assessment is displayed on 5 - point scale (see Annex 2 for methodology): Significant Obstruction Limited Obstruction No Net Impact Limited Contribution Significant Contribution Each of the bond’ s Use of Proceeds categories has been assessed for its contribution to, or obstruction of, the SDGs: USE OF PROCEEDS CONTRIBUTION OR OBSTRUCTION SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS Solar Power Significant contribution Wind Power Significant contribution,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sustainability Quality of the Issuer and Green Bond Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 5 o f 2 0 ISS ESG SPO ASSESSMENT PART I : GREEN BOND PRINCIPLES 1. Use of Proceeds An amount equal to the net proceeds from the issuance of green bonds will be used to partially or fully re/ finance Axpo's green projects, as defined below. ELIGIBLE GREEN PROJECT CATEGORIES ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR GREEN CATEGORIES Renewable energy Projects for the expansion and maintenance of renewable energies and the associated infrastructure as well as for the connection and distribution of the energy . Renewable energy sources include: • Photovoltaics: • Open space systems • R oof systems • Infrastructure systems (e.g. ski lifts, dams, noise barriers etc.) • Special systems (e.g. systems on greenhouses) • Wind power: • Onshore wind turbines • Hydropower: • Small hydropower plants with less than 20 MW generation capacity • Large hydropower plants that meet the requirements of recognized international environmental standards. This includes the requirements of the Climate Bond Initiative, the UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism, IFC reference standards for hydropower projects or equivalent requirement s. • Biomass: • Plants for recycling biomass, e.g. f ermentation plants • P lants for the thermal utilization of biomass, e.g. w ood power plants Biodiversity conservation Projects to protect and improve local biodiversity in the vicinity of renewable energy production facilities and the associated infrastructure, as well as infrastructure for connecting and distributing renewable energies. Biodiversity conservation projects can include the following categories: • Projects to protect terrestrial biodiversity • Pro jects to protect aquatic biodiversit y,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sustainability Quality of the Issuer and Green Bond Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 6 o f 2 0 Energy efficiency The increase in energy efficiency and the associated reduction in energy consumption is an essential element in creating an ecologically sustainable energy system. Energy efficiency projects can incl ude the following categories: • Transmission : Improvement of the infrastructure for the transmission and distribution of electricity with a view to increasing the transmission efficiency and reducing transmission losses • Production : Energy efficiency measures to increase electricity production in renewable energy production plants • Services: Increasing customers' energy efficiency Conversion of energy system s The energy system is changing across Europe. The decentralized elements are increasing, the passive consumer is turning into a demanding customer and «prosumer», digital intelligence is becoming central, and renewable energies are being added. Its volatile electricity production must be able to match demand, which is why technologies for electricity storage will continue to gain importance. Projects that contribute to the realignment towards a sustainable and future - proof energy system can include the follo wing categories: • Storage systems (e.g. battery storage, green hydrogen) • Smart grid applications • Smart meter applications • Intelligent control (e.g. Demand Side Management) • Green building technology • Electric mobility • Sector coupling (e.g. coupling of electricity - heat - gas ‘mobility’) Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Use of Proceeds description provided by Axpo’s Green Bond Framework as aligned with the Green Bond Principles . The eligible green categories are transparently defined and in line with the examples of project categories provided by the GBPs and with the issuer’s sustainability strategy . 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection In order to identify and select projects that meet the Axpo Green Bond criteria , Axpo has established a cross - departmental Green Bond Committee (GBC). The GBC meets at least once a year and is made up of members from the following departments within the Axpo organization: • Sustainability management • Group Treasury • Financial communication • R en ewable energies business units • Other functional teams (join the GBC as needed),S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sustainability Quality of the Issuer and Green Bond Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 7 o f 2 0 The GBC performs the following tasks: 1. The main task of the GBC is project selection. Potential green projects are checked for sustainability and environmental compatibility according to the criteria defined in the Green Bond Framework and added to a Green Bond project portfolio if they qualify (see process overview). 2. Validation of the annual investor report on the use of net proceeds from issuances . 3. Regular review of trends in the Sustainable Capital Markets to continuously ensure green bond reporting in accordance with the best market practices. 4. Review and update of the Green Bond Framework in the event of changes to Axpo's sustainability strategy . T he GBC’s process is summarized below: Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Process for Project Evaluation and Selection description provided by Axpo ’s Green Bond Framework as aligned with the Green Bond Principles . The evaluation and selection criteria are credible and transparently displayed. Responsibilities and steps of the Evaluation and Selection process are clearly define d . 3. Management of Proceeds Net proceeds from green bond issues are added to liquid assets of Axpo Holding AG and used to fully financ e and/or refinance green projects in the G reen B ond P ortfolio. Net proceeds from green bond issuances are allocated using a green bond register. In this register, the projects in the Green Bond GBC identifies potential green projects GBC assesses whether the identified projects align with Axpo's Green Bond criteria GBC approves green projects of Axpo group Green projects get added to or removed from the Green Bond Portfolio Axpo yearly informs on changes to the Green Bond Portfolio,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sustainability Quality of the Issuer and Green Bond Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 8 o f 2 0 Portfolio are matched to the net proceeds from Green Bond issu es. Group Treasury is responsible for the full allocation of these proceeds. Axpo intends that the net proceeds from green bond issues be allocated to the projects in the Green Bond Portfolio within three years . In principle, the net proceeds are to be use d to finance green projects that will be put into operation within the next 3 years, or to refinance projects that were commissioned no longer than three years ago. If the use of funds differs in individual cases from the financing periods mentioned above, this will be reported in a transparent manner as part of the annual reporting. In the event that net proceeds from green bond issuances have already been allocated to projects that no longer meet the green bond asset criteria of this framework, the funds available for financing and/or refinancing green projects in the green bond register will be increased and, if necessary , allocated to projects that continue to qualify for funding in accordance with the framework guidelines. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that Management of Proceeds proposed by Axpo ’s Green Bond Framework as aligned with the Green Bond Principles . Proceeds are appropriately earmarked and allocation options described. Regarding the allocation period however, Axpo envisages an expected allocation period to wards eligible projects within 3 years, which differs from best market practices of maximum one year . 4. Reporting Allocation Reporting Axpo will report annually on the use of the net proceeds from green bond issues until maturity of respective green bond s . These regular reports will be published in December as part of Axpo's annual reporting. The first publication is expected to take place in December 2020. The report will include the following information: • The total amount of the net proceeds from green bond issuances already allocated to the project portfolio • The breakdown of the allocated net proceeds from green bond issuances in regard to use for new financing, refinancing and amounts not yet allocated • A list of the green projects that were (re)financed in the year under review, including project descriptions • Reporting on any allocation adjustments in the Green Bond P ortfolio if projects no longer meet the Green Bond asset criteria of Axpo’s framework Impact Reporting When possible, Axpo will provide impact reporting on the expected environmental impacts of the (re)financed green projects .

C O M / E S G 1 9 o f 2 0 ANNEX 2 : Methodology ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs The ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs serves as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality – i.e. the social and environmental added value – of the use of proceeds of Axpo ’s Green Bond . It comprises firstly the definition of the use of proceeds category offering added social and/o r environmental value, and secondly the specific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the assets can be clearly identified and described. The sustainability criteria are complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measurement of the sustainability performance of the assets and which can also be used for reporting. To review the KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Federico Pezzolato (details below ) who will send them directly to you. Asset evaluation methodology ISS ESG evaluates whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eligible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bond KPIs. All percentages refer to the amount of assets within one category (e.g. wind power). Additionally, the assessment “no or limited information is available” represented by a red circle, either indicates that no information was made available to ISS ESG or that the information provided did not fulfil the requirements of th e ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs . ISS ESG requires a minimum of 50% of the asset pool to positively qualify against the KPIs, represented by a green tick. The evaluation was carried out using information and documents provided to ISS ESG on a confidential basis by Axpo (e.g. Due Diligence Reports). Further, national legislation and standards, depending on the asset location , were drawn on to complement the information provided by the issuer. Assessment of the contribution and association to the SDG The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG s) were endorsed in September 2015 by the United Nations and provide a benchmark for key opportunities and challenges toward a more sustainable future . Using a proprietary method, ISS ESG identifies the extent to which Axpo ’s Green Bond contributes to rela ted SDGs and has a positive association with their respective sub - targets .,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sustainability Quality of the Issuer and Green Bond Pool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 2 0 o f 2 0 About ISS ESG SPO ISS ESG is one of the world’s leading rating agencies in the field of sustainable investment. The agency analyses companies and countries regarding their environmental and social performance. As part of our Sustainable ( Green & Social ) Bo nd Services, we provide support for companies and institutions issuing sustainable bonds, advise them on the selection of categories of projects to be financed and help them to define ambitious criteria. We assess alignment with external principles (e.g. the ICMA Green / Social Bond Principles ), analyse the sustainability quality of the assets and review the sustainability performance of the issuer themselves. Following these three steps, we draw up an independent SPO so that investors are as well informed as possible about the quality of the bond / loan from a sustainability perspective .
