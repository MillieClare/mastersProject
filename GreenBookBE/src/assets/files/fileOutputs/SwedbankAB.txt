Sw e dbank is intending to issue a benchmark sized EURO bond of at least EURO 500 million (henceforth referred to as “ the Bond” ) and may issue further green bonds utilising the Swedbank Green Bond Framework . DNV GL Business Assurance Norway AS ( henceforth referred to as “ DNV GL ” ) has been commissioned by Swedbank to provide a Green Bond eligibility assessmen t on the Bond. Our methodology to achieve this is described under ‘Work Undertaken’ below. DNV GL wer e not commissioned to provide independent a ssurance or other audit activities . No assurance is provided regarding th e f inancial performance of the B ond, the v alue of any investments in the B ond, or the long term environmental benefits of the transaction. Our objective has been to provide an assessment that the B ond has met the criteria established on the basis set out below. Responsibilities of the Management of Swedbank and DNV GL The management of Swedbank has provided the information and data used by DNV GL during the delivery of this review . Our statement represents an independent opinion and is intended to inform Swedbank’s management and other interested stakeholders in the B ond as to whether the established criteria have been met, based on the information provided to us. In our work, DNV GL have relied on the information and the facts presented to us by Swedba nk . DNV GL is not responsible for any aspect of the projects or assets referred to in this opinion and cannot be held liable if estimates, findings, opinions, or conclusions are incorrect. Thus, DNV GL shall not be held liable if any of the information or data provided by Swedbank management and used as a basis for this assessment were not correct or complete.,Page 2 of 12 Basis of DNV GL’s opinion DNV GL have adapted our green bond eligibility assessment methodology to create Swedbank specific Green Bond Eligibility Ass essment Protocol ( henceforth referred to as “Protocol”) - see Schedule 2 . DNV GL’s Protocol includes a set of suitable criteria that can be used to underpin DNV GL’s opinion. The overarching principle behind the criteria is that a green bond should “enable capital - raising and investment for new and existing projects with environmental benefits”. As per DNV GL’s Protocol, t he criteria against which the Bond has been reviewed are grouped under the four Principles:  Principle One: Use of Proceeds . The Use of Proceeds criteria are guided by the requirement that an issuer of a green bond must use the funds raised to finance eligible activities. The eligible activities should produce clear environmental benefits.  Principle Two: Process for Project Evaluation and Selection . The Project Evaluation and Selection criteria are guided by the requirements that an issuer of a green bond should outline the process it follows when determining eligibility of an investment using Green Bond proceeds, and outline any impact objectives it will consider.  Principle Three: Management of Proceeds . The Management of Proceeds criteria are guided by the requirements that a green bond should be tracked within the issuing organization, that separate portfolios sho uld be created when necessary and that a declaration of how unallocated funds will be handled should be made.  Principle Four: Reporting . The Reporting criteria are guided by the recommendation that at least annual reporting to the bond investors should be made of the use of bond proceeds and that quantitative and/or qualitative performance indicators should be used, where feasible. Work undertaken DNV GL’s work constituted a high - level review of the available information, based on the understanding th at this information was provided to DNV GL by Swedbank in goo d faith. DNV GL have not performed an audit or other tests to check the veracity of the information provided to DNV GL . The work undertaken to form DNV GL’s opinion included:  C reation of a n Swedbank specific p rotocol , adapted to the purpose of the Bond, as described above and in Schedule 2 to this Assessment ;  Assessment of documentary evidence provided by Swedbank on the Bond and supplemented by a high - level desktop research. These che cks refer to current assessment best practices and standards methodology ;  Discussions with Swedbank management , and review of relevant documentation and evidence related to the criteria of the Protocol ;  D ocumentation of findings against each element of the criteria . DNV GL’s opinion as detailed below is a summary of these findings.,Page 3 of 12 Findings and DNV GL’s opinion DNV GL’s findings are listed below : 1. Principle One: Use of Proceeds . S wedbank intends to use the proceeds from the issuance of the Bonds to finance or refinance Eligible Green Assets. The Swedbank Green Bond Framework defines Eligible Green Assets as projects that fall into the following categories:  Renewable Energy ( Sustai nable Development Goal 7 & 13 )  Wind energy  Solar energy  Small scale hydro energy (hydropower plant of maximum 10 megawatts (MW) of generating capacity) or investments in existing larger hydro power plants (above 10 MW of generating capacity) for refurbishm ents without increasing the size of its impoundment facility  Energy Efficiency ( Sustainable Development Goal 7, 11 & 13 )  Green buildings, either residential or commercial real estate  Other energy efficiency projects, including infrastructure, technology, processes such as energy storage, smart grid solutions and district heating/cooling from renewable energy sources leading to reduced energy losses of at least 25%.  Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources ( Sustainable Development Goal 15 )  Polluti on Prevention and Control ( Sustainable Development Goal 6 & 11 )  Clean Transportation ( Sustainable Development Goal 9, 11 & 13 ) For th e inaugural Bond issuance, the Use of Proceeds will be aimed towards the Renewable Energy & Green Buildings categories and future issuances may be directed to the categories as presented in Schedule 1. DNV GL concludes that the above categories fall within the defined categories of the Green Bond Principles 2017. DNV GL also reviewed the Eligible Green Assets proposed for this bond and conclude they meet the definition within S wedbank’s Green Bond Framework. 2. Principle Two: Process for Pr oject Evaluation and Selection. DNV GL can confirm the p roject evaluation and selection will be carried out by the Green Bond Commit tee, chaired by the Head of Group Sustainability and consists of representatives from relevant functions such as Group Risk, Group Treasury, Large Corporate s and Institutions and Swedish Banking (Retail). The Green Bond Committee has ultimate responsibility for reviewing all of Swedbank’s existing loans & investments and determining their suitability to be an Eligible Green Asset . Applications are screened using a Green Bond Sustainability Analysis of the asset to determine if it is compliant with the criteria defined in the Swedbank Green Bond Framework in section 2 , including quantified environmental benefits.,Page 4 of 12 DNV GL has reviewed the evidence and can confirm that the Eligible Green Assets and the g overnance f ramework for project selection meet s the eligibility criteria defined by Swedbank in the Bond documentation, including the Swedbank Green Bond Framework. Swedbank has defined the criteria and process by which E ligible Green Assets are selected and described the key metrics used as well as defining the t eam resp onsible for selecting projects. 3. Principle Three: Management of Proceeds. DNV GL has reviewed evidence showing how Swedbank plans to trace the proceeds from the bond, from the time of issuance to the time of disbursement. The Swedbank Green Bond Framework includes a description of the functions and teams responsible for the tracking. The Green Asset Register will contain information on the assets financed with the p roc eeds including a unique identifier. DNV GL can confirm the proceeds from the bo nd issuance will be directly allocated to the refinancing of the Eligible Green Assets at settlement. In the event this is not possible, S wedbank has confirmed it will temporarily hold and/or invest, at its own discretion, in its liquidity portfol io, the balance of net proceeds not yet allocated to eligible projects. Swedbank will also prioritise utilising G reen B ond P rinciples compliant green bonds subject to market availability. DNV GL can also confirm S wedbank has committed to maintaining a h ealthy buffer of Eligible Green Assets available for investment. 4. Principle Four: Reporting. DNV GL can confirm Swedbank will report on the use of proceeds annually describing the allocation of proceeds and the share used for financing/re - financing. Swedbank will report on environmental impacts of the financed Eligible Green Assets annually until full allocation and as necessary thereafter in the event of material developments . The information reported on will include quantifi ed impacts as described in the Swedbank Green Bond Framework section 5.2 and aligned with the relevant Sustainable Development Goal . On the basis of the information provided by Swedbank and the work undertaken, it is DNV GL’s opinion that the Bond m eets the criteria established in the Protocol and that it is aligned with the stated definition of green bonds within the Green Bond Principles ” . for DNV GL Business Assurance Norway AS Oslo , 1 8 th October , 201 7 Douglas Farquhar Principal Consultant and Project Director DNV GL – Business Assurance,Page 5 of 12 About DNV GL Driven by our purpose of safeguarding life, property and the environment, DNV GL enables organisations to advance the safety and sustainability of their business.
