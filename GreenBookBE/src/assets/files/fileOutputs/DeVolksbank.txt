C O M / E S G 3 o f 1 3 Overall Evaluation of the green bond de Volksbank commissioned ISS-oekom to assist with its 2019 green bond by assessing three core elements to determine the sustainability quality of the bond: 1. de Volksbank’s green bond framework – benchmarked against the International Capital Market Association's (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (GBPs). 2. The asset pool – whether the projects aligned with ISS-oekom’s issue-specific key performance indicators (KPIs) (See Annex 2). 3. de Volksbank’s own sustainability performance, according to the ISS-oekom ESG corporate rating. ISS-oekom ASSESSMENT SUMMARY 1 The ISS-oekom’s present evaluation is valid for a single issuance following the SPO release date. The issuer’s Corporate rating has been last modified on the 29.03.2018 . SPO SECTION SUMMARY EVALUATION 1 Part 1: Alignment against the Green Bond Principles The issuer has defined a formal concept for its green bond regarding use of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the ICMA GBPs. Positive Part 2: Sustainability quality of the asset pool The overall sustainability quality of the asset pool in terms of sustainability benefits, risk avoidance and minimisation is good based upon the ISS-oekom Green Bond KPIs. The Green Bond KPIs contain a clear description of eligible asset category: private mortgages for new and existing residential green buildings. All assets of the asset pool are located in the Netherlands, a highly regulated and developed country. Legislative frameworks set high standards, which reduce environmental and social risks. Due to a low controversy risk, ISS-oekom did not carry out a controversy assessment for residential mortgage loans. Positive Part 3: Issuer sustainability performance The issuer is rated 1 st out of 61 companies within its sector as of 05.04.2019. It shows a very good sustainability performance and has been classified as ‘Prime’ within the methodology of the ISS-oekom Corporate Rating. The issuer rates significantly above the average performance of its sectorial peers on the four key ESG issues identified by ISS-oekom for the sector Financials/Mortgage & Public Sector Finance. Status: Prime Rating: B- Prime threshold: C,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N S us t ain ab il it y Qu al it y o f t h e G r e en Bon d A s s et Po o l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 4 o f 1 3 ISS-oekom SPO ASSESSMENT PART I: GREEN BOND PRINCIPLES 1. Use of Proceeds The net proceeds of the green bonds issued by de Volksbank under this framework will be allocated to an Eligible Green Loan Portfolio of new and existing loans, defined below, that contribute to a climate neutral balance sheet through reduced or avoided emissions. Because of de Volksbank’s climate goal on its balance sheet, CO 2 emissions, both caused and avoided, is a key investment parameter for all investment decisions by de Volksbank. ASSET CATEGORY INCLUDED IN GREEN BOND PORTFOLIO SHARE OF ASSET POOL 1. Green Buildings     Yes 100% 2. Energy Efficiency ✕ No - The Eligible Green Loan Portfolio can include financing and refinancing to investments, expenditures and/or loans as defined in the following criteria: • Green buildings: defined as buildings which meet the following criteria: i. New or existing residential buildings with an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) label “A” in the Netherlands ii. Refurbished Dutch residential buildings with at least a 30% improvement in energy efficiency, which is equivalent to two EPC label steps improvement and a minimum energy label C. De Volksbank may provide dedicated residential refurbishment loans. • Energy Efficiency: Measures contributing to a more efficient use of energy, such as but not limited to: • Geothermal or Hybrid heat pumps • Alternative heating • Floor, wall and roof isolation • Energy efficient windows, doors and frames • Energy efficiency advisory • Energy storage • Energy efficient lighting such as LED Although the framework covers two categories, this bond is fully dedicated to Category 1, Green Buildings, focused on residential mortgages. Opinion: ISS-oekom considers the use of proceeds description provided by de Volksbank’s Green Bond Framework as aligned with the Green Bond Principles. In addition, the sustainability objectives related to those use of proceeds categories are in line with the overall sustainability strategy and targets of the issuer, especially regarding CO 2 emissions reduction.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N S us t ain ab il it y Qu al it y o f t h e G r e en Bon d A s s et Po o l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 5 o f 1 3 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection De Volksbank requires that loans comply with official national and international environmental and social standards, laws and regulations. It is also part of de Volksbank’s transaction approval process to ensure that loans comply with de Volksbank’s sustainability policy, including those financed with the proceeds of the Green Bonds. Projects as proposed by various business areas of de Volksbank are evaluated and selected by de Volksbank’s Climate Neutral Committee (CNC), based on compliance with the Eligibility Criteria brought forward in this framework. Chaired by the CFO of de Volksbank, the CNC determines how it wishes to achieve the climate neutrality objective for the bank balance sheet. In addition, the CNC monitors progress, establishes actual figures and determines the Carbon Profit & Loss Methodology. The CNC is composed out of representatives of the Treasury Department, Balance Sheet Management and Accounting, Reporting and Control, the director of ASN Bank, a sustainability process manager and a climate impact advisor of ASN Bank and the director of the Mortgage Competence Center. The CNC will approve any future updates to the Framework, including expansions to the list of Eligible Categories for future bond issues, and oversee its implementation. In identifying eligible assets (such as green buildings) and their non-financial impacts, de Volksbank may rely on external consultants and their data sources as well. ASN Bank's Sustainability Expertise Center takes the lead in maintaining and implementing the investment policy and policies relevant to the climate impact to arrive at a climate neutral balance sheet by 2030 and in developing other human rights and biodiversity initiatives. Once every quarter, the results of the climate neutral balance sheet are discussed and approved by the climate neutral committee chaired by the CFO. Sustainable Housing and financial resilience have been assigned to the Marketing department. These eligibility criteria and minimum requirements and ESG related matters are continuously developed and reviewed in its external and internal policy frameworks. Opinion: ISS-oekom finds that the process for project evaluation and selection defined in de Volksbank's Green Bond Framework is aligned with the Green Bond Principles. Eligibility criteria are defined, publicly available and transparent, even if generic for the energy efficiency assets. The process of evaluation and selection based on those criteria is transparent, structured and ensures the relevant management of potential ESG risks related to the assets. The departments in charge of the implementation and monitoring of this process are clearly identified and have the relevant expertise to conduct the projects’ evaluation and selection. Finally, the aim of a climate neutral balance sheet is above the general green bond market practice. 3. Management of Proceeds The Green Bond Proceeds will be managed by de Volksbank in a portfolio approach. De Volksbank intends to allocate the proceeds from the Green Bonds to an Eligible Green Loan Portfolio, selected in accordance with the Use of Proceeds criteria and Evaluation and Selection Process presented above. De Volksbank will strive, over time, to achieve a level of allocation for the Eligible Green Loan Portfolio which matches or exceeds the balance of net proceeds from its outstanding Green Bonds. Additional Eligible Green Loans will be added to de Volksbank’s Eligible Green Loan Portfolio to the extent required.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N S us t ain ab il it y Qu al it y o f t h e G r e en Bon d A s s et Po o l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 6 o f 1 3 Pending the full allocation of the Proceeds, or in case of an insufficient Eligible Green Loan Portfolio, de Volksbank will hold and/or invest, at its own discretion, the balance of net proceeds not yet allocated to the Eligible Green Loan Portfolio in its treasury liquidity portfolio, in cash or other short term and liquid instruments with a sustainable character (such as green and social bonds). De Volksbank CNC will review and approve allocations of bond proceeds to Eligible Green Loan Portfolio on at least an annual basis. Opinion: ISS-oekom finds that the management of proceeds described in de Volksbank's Green Bond Framework is aligned with the Green Bond Principles. The Green Bond proceeds are properly tracked and managed separately from the overall balance sheet of the issuer. The allocation process is defined, transparent and considers sustainability criteria for potential temporary investments. Proceeds will be 100% allocated at issuance and the pool will by dynamic over time. De Volksbank will report the amount of new and existing financing. 4. Reporting De Volksbank will make and keep readily available reporting on the allocation of net proceeds to the Eligible Green Loan Portfolio after a year from the issuance of the applicable Green Bond, to be renewed annually. De Volksbank will report the allocation of the Use of Proceeds to the Eligible Green Loan Portfolio at least at the category level and on an aggregated basis for all of de Volksbank’s green bonds. De Volksbank will also report on the progress of the climate neutral balance sheet, and the extent to which the green bond has contributed to the climate neutral balance sheet. De Volksbank intends to align the reporting with the methodology proposed by Platform Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) as proposed in the latest report of December 2018; ‘Harmonising and implementing a carbon accounting approach for the financial sector’. PCAF develops a uniform, open-source and transparent carbon accounting methodology for the financial sector. For more information see http://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/ . Allocation Reporting The allocation report will provide, for each Eligible category: • the total amount of proceeds allocated to Eligible Loans per category • the number of Eligible Loans • the balance of unallocated proceeds • the amount or the percentage of new financing and refinancing Environmental impact reporting De Volksbank commits to provide an annual non-financial impact report on climate impact associated to major categories of Eligible Loans, i.e.: • For Green Buildings Eligible Loans on: • Estimated ex-ante annual energy consumption and energy saving in KWh/m2,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N S us t ain ab il it y Qu al it y o f t h e G r e en Bon d A s s et Po o l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 7 o f 1 3 • Estimated annual financed emissions and avoided/reduced emissions in tonnes of CO 2 equivalents • For Energy Efficiency Loans on: • Number of loans • Total amount committed • Examples and/or case studies of selected projects • If available, estimated avoided emissions in tons of CO 2 equivalent • The contribution to de Volksbank’s goal towards a climate neutral balance sheet • Estimated annual financed emissions and avoided emissions in tons of CO 2 equivalent • Contribution to the total annual financed emissions and avoided/reduced emissions in percentages Both the allocation report as well as the impact report will be made available via the de Volksbank website 2 . Opinion: ISS-oekom finds that the expected reporting described in de Volksbank’s Green Bond Framework is aligned with the Green Bond Principles. The intended use of proceeds and impact reporting are in line with the market best practices, will be publicly available and reviewed by a third- party verifier. External review Second party opinion de Volksbank Green Bond Framework has been reviewed by ISS-oekom who has issued a SPO. The SPO as well as the Green Bond Framework will be made available to investors through de Volksbank website. Verification de Volksbank will request on an annual basis, starting one year after issuance and until maturity, a limited assurance report of the allocation of the bond proceeds to eligible assets, provided by its external auditor (EY or any subsequent external auditor). 2 https://www.devolksbank.nl/investor-relations-1.html,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N S us t ain ab il it y Qu al it y o f t h e G r e en Bon d A s s et Po o l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 8 o f 1 3 PART II: SUSTAINABILITY QUALITY OF THE GREEN BOND ASSET POOL Evaluation of the assets P r i v a t e m o r t g a g e s f o r r e s i d e n t i a l g r e e n b u i l d i n g s Prerequisites on Energy Efficiency of the residential buildings  All the assets underwent an appropriate and detailed selection process that ensures good standards regarding energy efficiency. New or existing residential buildings received an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) label “A” in the Netherlands. 1. Construction standards  100% of the assets are located in the Netherlands, where high labour and health and safety standards are in place for construction and maintenance work (e.g. ILO core conventions). 2. Responsible treatment of customers with debt repayment problems  For 100% of the assets, pre-emptive actions to prevent client debt repayment problems are in place (eg. educational programmes for clients, covenants limiting indebtedness, pro- actively approaching customers potentially at risk).  For 100% of the assets, basic sustainable solutions for customers with debt repayment problems are in place (e.g. internal debt counselling).  The contractor handles mortgage payment difficulties responsibly by guaranteeing that all alternative options are examined before undertaking foreclosure as a last resort. Controversy assessment - Due to a low controversy risk, ISS - oekom does not carry out a controversy assessment for residential mortgage loans. The methodology for the asset evaluation can be found in Annex 2.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N S us t ain ab il it y Qu al it y o f t h e G r e en Bon d A s s et Po o l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 9 o f 1 3 PART III: ASSESSMENT OF DE VOLKSBANK’S SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE The ISS-oekom Corporate Rating comprises a rating scale from A+ (excellent) to D- (poor). C O M P A N Y D E V O L K S B A N K R A T I N G B - S T A T U S P R I M E This means that the company performed well in terms of sustainability, both compared against others in the industry and in terms of the industry-specific requirements defined by ISS-oekom. In ISS-oekom’s view, the securities issued by the company therefore all meet the basic requirements for sustainable investments. As of 17.04.2018, this rating places de Volksbank 1 st out of 61 companies rated by ISS-oekom in the Financials/Mortgage & Public Sector Finance sector. Key Challenges facing companies in term of sustainability management in this sector are:  Sustainability impacts of lending and other financial services/products  Statutory ESG-standards linked to the geographical allocation of the lending portfolio  Customer and product responsibility  Employee relations and work environment In all the key issues, de Volksbank rates above the average for the sector. A very significant outperformance was achieved in “Sustainability impacts of lending and other financial services/products” and “Customer and product responsibility” criteria. The company has a minor controversy level. Details on the rating of the issuer can be found in Annex 1.

C O M / E S G 1 2 o f 1 3 ANNEX 2: Methodology ISS-oekom Green Bond KPIs The ISS-oekom Green Bond KPIs serves as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality – i.e. the social and environmental added value – of the use of proceeds of de Volksbank green bond. It comprises firstly the definition of the use of proceeds category offering added social and/or environmental value, and secondly the specific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the assets can be clearly identified and described. The sustainability criteria are complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measurement of the sustainability performance of the assets and which can also be used for reporting. To review the KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Federico Pezzolato (details below) who will send them directly to you. Asset evaluation methodology ISS-oekom evaluates whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eligible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bond KPIs. All percentages refer to the amount of assets within one category (e.g. wind power). Additionally, the assessment “no or limited information is available” either indicates that no information was made available to ISS-oekom or that the information provided did not fulfil the requirements of the ISS-oekom Green Bond KPIs. The evaluation was carried out using information and documents provided to ISS-oekom on a confidential basis by de Volksbank (e.g. Due Diligence Reports). Further, national legislation and standards, depending on the asset location, were drawn on to complement the information provided by the issuer.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N S us t ain ab il it y Qu al it y o f t h e G r e en Bon d A s s et Po o l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 3 o f 1 3 About ISS-oekom SPO ISS-oekom is one of the world’s leading rating agencies in the field of sustainable investment. The agency analyses companies and countries regarding their environmental and social performance. As part of our Green/Social/Sustainability Bond Services, we provide support for companies and institutions issuing sustainable bonds, advise them on the selection of categories of projects to be financed and help them to define ambitious criteria. We assess alignment with external principles (e.g. the ICMA Green Bond Principles), analyse the sustainability quality of the assets and review the sustainability performance of the issuer themselves. Following these three steps, we draw up an independent SPO so that investors are as well informed as possible about the quality of the bond / loan from a sustainability perspective.
