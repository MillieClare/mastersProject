TVA has developed the Tennessee Valley Authority Sustainable Financing Framework (the “Framework”) under which it intends to issue sustainability bonds and/ or loans and use the procee ds to finance and/or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and/or future expenditures (the “Eligible Sustainable Expenditures” or the “ Eligible Expenditures” ) towards eligible projects that are expected to create positive environmenta l and social impact for the people of the Tennessee Valley . The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in six areas : 1. Renewable Energy 2. Energy Efficiency 3. Climate Change Adaptation 4. Green Innovation 5. Access to essential services (electricity) (“Access to Electricity”) 6. Access to essential services (broadband internet) (“Access to B roadband I nternet”) TVA engaged Sustainalytics to review the Tennessee Valley Authority Sustainable Financing Framework , dated September 2021 , and provide a S econd - P arty O pinion on the Framework’ s environmental and social credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 20 2 1 (GBP), Social Bond Principles 202 1 (SBP), Sustainability Bond Guidelines 20 2 1 (SBG) 2 , Green Loan Principles 2021 (GLP) , and Social Loan Principles 2021 (SLP) 3 . This Framework has been published in a separate document. 4 Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ’ Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent 5 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible project categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • T he Framework’s alignment with th e Sustainability B ond Guidelines 20 2 1 , Green Bond Principles 20 2 1 , and Social Bond Principles 20 2 1 , as administered by ICMA , and the Green Loan Principles 2021 and Social Loan Principles 2021, as administered by LMA, APLMA, and LSTA ; • The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and • The alignment of the issuer ’ s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.8 , which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of TVA ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. TVA representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the s ole responsibility of TVA to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and 1 U.S. Census Bureau, “Quick Facts - Tennessee ”, at: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/TN 2 The Green Bond Principles, Social Bond Principles, and Sustainability Bond Guidelines are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are availa ble at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/sustainability - bond - guidelines - sbg/ 3 The Green Loan Principles and S ocial Loan Principles are administered by the Loan Market Association, Asia Pacific Loan Market Association and Loan Syndications & Trading Association and are available at: https://www.ls ta.org/content/green - loan - principles/# and https://www.lsta.org/content/social - loan - principles - slp/ 4 The Tennessee Valley Authority Sustainable Financing Framework is available on Tennessee Valley Authority ’s website at: https://tva.q4ir.com/esg/ 5 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustainalytics and ensuring an alyst independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust con flict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consistency of process, structural separation of com mercial and research (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analy st compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparency.,Second - Party Opinion Tennessee Valley Authority Sustainable Financing Framework 3 (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a time ly manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. Any update of the present Second - Party Opin ion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and TVA . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - P arty Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with bond and loan proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framewo rk is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the potential allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee the realised allocation of the bond and loan proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or argument , either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and relat ed surrounding circumstances that TVA has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second - Party Opinion . Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Tennessee Valley Authority Sustainable Financing Framework Sustaina lytics is of the opinion that the Tennessee Valley Authority Sustainable Financing Framework is credible, impactful and aligns with the four core components of the GBP , SBP , GLP , and SLP . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of TVA ’s Sustainability Bond Framework: • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible categor ies – Renewable Energy , Energy Efficiency , Climate Change Adaptation , Green Innovation , Access to Electricity , and Access to Broadband Internet – are aligned with those recognized by the GBP , SBP , GLP , and SLP . - TVA has indicated a two - year look - back period for its refinancing activities, which Sustainalytics considers to be in line with market practice. - Under the Renewable Energy category, the Issuer may finance expenditures related to renewable energy projects, in particular, wind and solar power . Sustainalytics views the criteria to be aligned with market practice. - Under the Energy Efficiency category, the Framework allows for investments in battery storage and related grid assets . Sustainalytics considers investments in energy storage systems and associated assets to be aligned with market practice. - Under the Climate Adaptation category, the Issuer intends to invest in resilient and reliable electricity transmission infrastructure within its service territory 6 which is specifically intended to withstand the impacts of climate change . ▪ Sustainalytics notes that TVA has a comprehensive Climate Adaptation Plan, 7 through which it mandates vulnerability assessment s to identify climate - related impacts and risks for all adaptation project s, follow ed by a principle - based adaptation plan that speaks to the identified risks and prioritizes efforts in the most vulnerable areas . Sustainalytics views investments in infrastructure adaptation projects based on climate risk identification and mitigation plan to be aligned with market practice. 6 TVA document, “County/State TVA Service Territory”, at: https://irp - cdn.multiscreensite.com/d980f98f/files/uploaded/TVA%20Service%20Area%20CountyState%202018.pdf 7 TVA document, “ Climate Chan ge Adaptation an d Resiliency Plan 2020 Update ”, at: https://tva - azr - eastus - cdn - ep - tvawcm - prd.azureedge.net/cdn - tvawcma/docs/default - source/about - tva/guidelines - reports/climate - statements - plans/2020 - climate - adaptation - plan.pdf?sfvrsn=c3506352_2,Second - Party Opinion Tennessee Valley Authority Sustainable Financing Framework 4 - Under the Green Innovation category, TVA intends to finance expenditures related to research and development activities, with a primary focus on carbon - free and/or energy - efficient solutions that are aligned with the categories defined in the Framework . TVA has confirmed that it wil l limit investments under this category to a small percentage of allocated proceeds . Sustainalytics recognizes the positive intent of this category , noting that market practice for R&D initiatives is to specifically target improved environmental outcomes a nd encouraging TVA to report on specific projects undertaken in this category . - Under the Access to Electricity category, the Issuer may invest in t ransmission infrastructure upgrades in rural and/or low - income areas (the “Underserved Areas”) with an a im to enhance system reliability and spur economic development . ▪ T he Issuer intends to invest in (i) expansion or replacement of transmission lines and associated equipment in the Underserved Areas that help r educe outages , (ii) a dd ing additional delivery point s with local pow er companies in the Underserved Areas , with an aim to create backup feeds for load and add capacity to handle extreme loading events , and (iii) climate resiliency upgrades in the same areas. Sustainalytics recognizes TVA ’s intent of providing reliable access to electricity in well - defined underserved regions while also noting that the investments are directly aligned with the Issuer’s primary business function ; Sustainalytics considers the criteria to be aligned with mark et practice . - For the Access to Broadband Internet category, TVA intends to finance capital expenditures related to providing high - speed, broadband internet inf rastructure to rural and/or low - income communities, in particular, the costs related to the deployment of fiber network. Sustainalytics recognizes the need to address the “digital divide” and the potential that increased access to improved digital infrastructures has to promote socioeconomic advancement in rural and low - income communities and considers the criteria for focusing investments on well - defined populations to be aligned with market practice . • Project Evaluation and Selection: - TVA’s Treas ury department, along with its internal accounting and other functions, will be responsible for the evaluation and selection of Eligible Expenditures , per the criteria defined in the Framework. - The Issuer’s Financial Operations & Performance department , or equivalent functions, will provide oversight on the project evaluation and selection activities through its capital planning process and business planning function. - TVA has adopted a comprehensive Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Plan along with other policies and processes to evaluate applicable environmental and social risks , including tho se tha t are associated with a ll allocation decisions made under the Framework. For additional details, s ee Section 2. - Based on the clear delineation of responsibility , Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - TVA’s Treasury department , along with its business planning, accounting, and other internal re sources, will be responsible for the allocation and tracking of bond proceeds per the criteria defined in the Framework. - U nallocated proceeds may be held in cash, cash equivalents or invested in liquid marketable instruments, in accordance with TVA’s liqui dity management policy. TVA has not disclosed the period over which it intend s to achieve full allocat ion; Sustainalytics considers it market practice that where feasible proceeds be allocated within three years of issuance . - Based on the disclosures related to management approaches and the temporary use of unallocated proceeds , Sustainalytics conside rs this process to be in line with market practice. • Reporting: - TVA intends to repor t on the allocation and where feasible, the impact of proceeds on its website approximately one year from the date of the bond issuance and annually until full allocation, and thereafter in the event of material developments . - Allocation reporting is expected to include category - level details on the allocation of proceeds, brief description of eligible projects, and the balance of unallocated proceeds and will be asserted by TVA’s management.,Second - Party Opinion Tennessee Valley Authority Sustainable Financing Framework 5 - Impact reporting is expected to pro vide category - level impact of the Eligible Expenditures against respective key performance indicators including (i) annual greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions avoided, (ii) increase in grid resilience, generation and storage (MWh), and (iii) number of beneficiaries associated with transmission infrastructure upgrade projects . - Based on T VA’s commitment to allocation reporting and , where feasible, impact reporting, Sustainalytics conside rs this process to be in line with market practice. Alignment with S ustainability Bond Guidelines 20 2 1 Sustainalytics has determined that the Tennessee Valley Authority Sustainable Financing Framework aligns with the four core components of the GBP , SBP , GLP , and SLP . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 1: Sustainability Bond/ Sustainability B ond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of TVA Contribution of Framework to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s sustainability strategy Sustainalytics is of the opinion that TVA demonstrates a commitment to sustainability through its focus on the three key environmental and social areas outlined in its mission : (i) Delivering safe, low cost, reliable power , (ii) Providing responsible stewa rdship of natural resources and (iii) Creating sustainable economic growth. 8 TVA's activities are guided by the TVA Act 1993, which calls upon it to improve the navigability and flood control of the Tennessee River, reforestation and proper use of margina l lands, national defense, and agricultural and industrial development in the Tennessee Valley. 9 TVA ’s Strategic Intent and Guiding Principles provides the direction for all its energy supply and decarbonization initiatives in accordance with its mission and mandate . 10 Sustainalytics highlights the following aspects of the Issuer’s strategy and historical performance for being particularly aligned with the Framework: • TVA achieved a 63% reduction in its carbon emissions in FY2020, compared with a 2005 basel ine. It has set targets to reach an 80% reduction by 2035 and net - zero carbon emissions by 2050. 11 • In FY2020, 59% of the energy produced by TVA was carbon free, from nuclear, hydroelectric, solar and wind sources. 12 The total existing and contracted renew able energy capacity reached 7,044 megawatts in the same year, with close to 1,600 megawatts in solar capacity alone. 13 In addition, TVA plans to add 10,000 megawatts of solar by 2035. 14 • TVA has a comprehensive portfolio of renewable energy programs (calle d TVA Green) and energy efficiency programs (called TVA EnergyRight) for its residential and business customers. As of FY2020, the programs under TVA Green accounted for over 300 gigawatt - hours in green power sales 15 and those under TVA EnergyRight account ed for around 50 gigawatt - hours in energy efficiency savings. 16 • TVA has also set a target to have 200,000 electric vehicles (EV) in the Tennessee Valley by 2028 from 16,000 in 2020, resulting in almost 1 million metric tons of CO 2 savings per year. 17 In November 2020, the TVA Board approved the development of a new EV Policy with a new commercial rate structure to support electric vehicle charging infrastructure. It is also actively involved in creating a 8 TVA report, “FY2020 Sustainability Report”, (p7) , at: https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental - stewardship/sustainability/sustainability - report 9 TVA website, “Tennessee Valley Authority Act”, at: https://tva - azr - eastus - cdn - ep - tvawcm - prd.azureedge.net/cdn - tvawcm a/docs/default - source/default - document - library/site - content/about - tva/tva_act.pdf?sfvrsn=99c2b8c4_0 10 TVA website, “TVA Strategic Intent and Guiding Principles”, at: https://tva - azr - eastus - cdn - ep - tvawcm - prd.azureedge.net/cdn - tvawcma/docs/default - source/about - tva/board - of - directors/may - 6 - 2021/strategic - plan - documentc67079e2 - d479 - 4f3d - a13b - 1fa6fd714cde.pdf?sfvrsn=bc7bb2e8_7 11 TVA report, “FY2020 Sustainability Report”, (p15), at: https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental - stewardship/sustainability/sustainability - report 12 TVA website, “ Our Power System”, at: https://www.tva.com/energy/our - power - system 13 TVA report, “ Renewables Highlights Fiscal Year 2020”, at: https://tva - azr - eastus - cdn - ep - tvawcm - prd.azureedge.net/cdn - tvawcma/docs/default - source/energy/valley - renewable - energy/renewables_highlight_report - 4 - 8 - 2134530957 - c68e - 4495 - b045 - b799893d3f97.pdf?sfvrsn=df252df_3 14 TVA report, “FY2020 Sustainab ility Report”, (p17), at: https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental - stewardship/sustainability/sustainability - report 15 TVA report, “Renewables Highlights Fiscal Year 2020”, at: https://tva - azr - eastus - cdn - ep - tvawcm - prd.azureedge.net/cdn - tvawcma/docs/default - source/energy/valley - renewable - energy/renewables_hi ghlight_report - 4 - 8 - 2134530957 - c68e - 4495 - b045 - b799893d3f97.pdf?sfvrsn=df252df_3 16 TVA report, “EnergyRight 2020 Highlights Report”, at: https://prod.tva - ers.media.energyright.com/wp - content/uploads/2021/03/EnergyRight_HighlightsReport2020.pdf 17 TVA report, “FY2020 Sustainability Report”, (p13), at: https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental - stewardship/sustainability/sustainability - report,Second - Party Opinion Tennessee Valley Authority Sustainable Financing Framework 6 network of charging stations in partnership wi th state agencies, local power companies and developers, creating awareness tools and programs for consumers and building coalitions. 18 • TVA actively plans for and manages the risks posed by climate change in its operations. TVA’s 2020 Climate Change Adapta tion and Resilience Plan, developed in accordance with the U.S. Federal Government’s Fourth National Climate Assessment provides a comprehensive overview of the climate change risks and operational vulnerabilities faced by TVA in the short - and long - term, and the programs and policies in place to mitigate them. 19 • TVA has a specific focus on promoting small and diverse businesses in its supply chain and tracks its own performance in promoting such businesses. In FY2020, it spent USD 8.44 million with small businesses and USD 388 million with diverse businesses. 20 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Tennessee Valley Authority Sustainable Financing Framework is aligned with the Issuer ’s overall sustainability strategy and initiatives and will furth er the Issuer ’s action on its key environmental priorities. Well - positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the use of proceeds from the Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are expected to have positive environmental and social impact, Sustainalytics is aware that such eligible projects could also lead to negative environmental and social outcomes. Some key environmental and socia l risks associated with the eligible projects, could include land use and biodiversity issues associated with large - scale infrastructure development, emissions, effluents, and waste generated in construction and stakeholder participation. • Land - use and biodiversity: TVA manages 2 93,000 acres of public land and 11,000 miles of shoreline for integrated operation of the TVA reservoir, power systems, for activities that enhance the economic opportunities in the region and for public recreation purposes. 21 TVA's strategy to manage this land is set by its Land Policy and operationalized through its Reservoir Land Management Plans. It also actively addresses issues such as shoreline stabilization, protection of archeological and historically important sites and preservation of wildlife in its land and projects. 22 • Environmental management: Under its 2020 Environmental Policy, TVA commits to produce reliable, affordable , and increasingly clean energy, proactive stewardship of the Tennessee River system and public lands and support sustainabl e economic growth in the region. 23 TVA maintains an Environmental Management System to reduce its environmental footprint and foster continuous improvement. Under its Environmental Policy, TVA establishes goals, measures progress and reports performance ag ainst six environmental goals - climate change mitigation, air quality improvement, water resource monitoring, waste minimization, environmental reviews and sustainable land use and natural resource management. 24 TVA also complies with applicable laws and regulations . For example, as part of its environmental reviews, it complies with the National Environmental Policy Act which requires federal agencies to consider the effects of their projects on human and natural environment before finalization. 25 • Stakeho lder participation: TVA has various channels to collect and address stakeholder feedback, including public meetings and open houses, hearings, ratepayer complaint resolution process, ombudsman, and direct interactions and internet communications. 26 TVA als o has two Advisory Councils - Regional Energy R esource Council and Regional Resource Stewardship Council for public and private sectors to provide inputs on energy and environmental stewardship issues. The Council members are nominated by the governors of the seven states in TVA's service area, distributors of TVA power, TVA's directly served customers and other stakeholders. 27 18 TVA website, “Electric Vehicles”, at: https://www.tva. com/energy/technology - innovation/electric - vehicles 19 TVA report, “Climate Change Adaptation and resilience Plan 2020 Update”, at: https://tva - azr - eastus - cdn - ep - tvawcm - prd.azureedge.net/cdn - tvawcma/docs/default - source/about - tva/guidelines - reports/climate - statements - plans/2020 - climate - adaptation - plan.pdf ?sfvrsn=c3506352_2 20 TVA report, “FY2020 Sustainability Report”, (p37), at: https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental - stewardship/sustainability/sustainability - report 21 TVA report, “FY2020 Sustainability Report”, (p25), at: https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental - stewardship/sustainability/sustainability - report 22 TVA website, “Land Management”, at: https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental - stewardship/land - management 23 TVA website, “Environmental Policy”, at: https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental - stewardship/land - management 24 Ibid. 25 TVA website, “NEPA at TVA”, at: https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental - stewardship/environmental - reviews/nepa - at - tva 26 TVA website, “Ombudsman”, at: https://www.tva.com/about - tva/ombudsman 27 TVA website, “About TVA”, at: https://www.tva.com/about - tva,Second - Party Opinion Tennessee Valley Authority Sustainable Financing Framework 7 In addition to the above, TVA has an Enterprise Risk Council ( “ ERC ” ) which is responsible for the highest level of risk oversight. TVA's Chief Sustainability Officer and the Chief Risk Officer are both members of its Risk Management Steering Committee th at reports to the ERC. The Chief Risk Officer also heads the Enterprise Risk Management business unit, that establishes risk manageme nt policies and guidelines and conducts risk assessments. 28 In line with its statutory requirements as a government - owned corporation, TVA also has governance structures in place to ensure accountability. Aside from oversight from its Board of Directors, T VA is accountable to the Congress, Government Accountability Office, Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Treasury and the Office of the Inspector General. In addition, it also reports against the standards laid out by the Global Reporting Initiative, CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), Edison Electric Institute, Electric Power Research Institute, the Whitehouse Council for Environment Quality and the Task Force on Climate - Related Disclosures. Based on these policies, standards and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that TVA has implemented adequate measures and is well - positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible categories. Section 3: Impact of Use of Procee ds All six use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by GBP , SBP, GLP or SLP . Sustainalytics has focused on t wo below where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context. Importance of renewable energy in the U.S. The e lectricity sector is the second largest source of GHG emissions in the U.S., accounting for 25% of total GHG emissions in 2019. 29 As of 2020, 60% of the electricity generation in the U.S. comes from fossil fuels such as natural gas, coal and petroleum . 30 From 1990 to 2019, GHG emissions from electricity generation decreased by 12% as a result of the increase in renewable energy and energy efficiency. 31 While renewable energy accounted for just 20% of the total electricity generated in 2020, 32 between 2014 and 2019, wind and solar contributed to 58% of all new generating capacity added to the U.S. grids. 33 In April 2021, the Federal Government set a goal to reach 100% carbon - free electricity by 2035, 34 and this is expected to further add to the momentum for renewable energy in the U.S. TVA's efforts towards increasing the share of renewable energy in its network (as detailed in Section 2) are likely to contribute towards this federal target. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the use of proc eeds for increasing renewable energy is expected to support the clean energy transition in the U.S and have positive environmental impacts. Importance of reliable and climate - resilient power systems in the U.S. Weather - related events account for over 80% of power outages in the U.S. 35 In the decade between 2003 and 2012, the U.S . saw a doubling in the number of weather - related power outages, affecting an average of 15 million households and businesses annua lly. 36 Extreme weather events can include high winds, thunderstorms, hurricanes, heat waves, intense cold periods, intense snow events and ice storms, and extreme rainfall . 37 Climate change is expected to exacerbate such events, disrupting power generation , transmission, distribution as well as demand. 38 For example, i n March 2021, over four million people in Texas were affected by grid failures and the resulting blackouts, spurred by extreme cold weather conditions that 28 TVA report, “FY2020 Sustainability Report”, (p7), at: https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental - stewardship/sustainability/sustainability - report 29 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website, “Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions”, at: https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources - greenhouse - gas - emissions#electricity 30 U.S. Energy Information Administration website, “Electricity Explained”, at: https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity - in - the - us.php 31 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website , “Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions”, at: https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources - greenhouse - gas - emissions#electricity 32 U.S. Energy Information Administration website, “Electricity Explained”, at: https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity - in - the - us.php 33 Bolinger, M.

The average thermal power plant in the U.S. i s over 30 years old and more than 70% of transmission lines a nd transformers are over 25 years old. 40 P ower grid reliability varies considerably across regions, and grid failures can disproportionately affect underserved and marginalize d populations . 41 The l oss of power during extreme weather events can lead to ripple effects such as costs of lost output and wages, spoiled inventory and restarting operations. 42 The U.S. Department of Energy reports that between 2003 and 2012, weather - related outages cost US D 18 to 33 billion per year. 43 A 2021 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office calls for the development for strategies to identify and assess climate risks to the power grids and enhance grid resilience. 44 TVA integrates climate adaptation and resilience in its own operational and regional level plan ning efforts and conducts detailed assessment of risks and resilience measures, as laid out in its 2020 Climate Adaptation Plan. 45 Based on the above context, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that TVA’s efforts to build resilience and reliability of its e lectricity infrastructure based on detailed assessments are expected to have positive environmental and socia l impacts. 39 Plumer, B.

Second - Party Opinion: An institution with sustainability expertise that is independent from the issuer may provide a Second - Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Sustainability Bond framework, or appropriate procedures such as information barriers will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second - Party Opinion. It normally entai ls an assessment of the alignment with the Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy, and/or processes relating to sustainability and an evaluation of the environmental and social featu res of the type of Projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or sustainability criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims m ade by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally or socially sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Sustainability Bond proceeds, statement of environmental or social impact or alignment of reporting with the Principles may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Sustainability Bond or ass ociated Sustainability Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external sustainability standard or label.
