‘Second Opinion’ on Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework April 09 th 2018,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework 2 Summary Overall, Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework, together with the bank’s policies, provide a sound base for climate friendly investments. Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework is in line with the recommendations of the Green Bond Principles. The fram ework lists eligible projects that support the transition to low carbon, climate resilient growth and a sustainable economy. The company has clear guidelines for the management of the green bond proceeds. Landshypotek Bank will report on various impact ind icators of projects financed by the green bond proceeds. These reports will be available to both investors and the public . The framework promotes climate mitigation measures in the form of renewable energy and green building projects. The project category Sustainable Forestry promotes both climate mitigation and adaptation. Forests is an important element in the low - carbon and climate resilient society. Avoiding deforestation and forest degradation combined with afforestation will play a n important role in reducing CO 2 emissions and sequestering carbon to counterbalance emissions from other sources. The two most common approaches of utilizing forests in a climate perspective are to protect and sequester carbon or , as in this case, managing forests sustainabl y, which will provide raw materials and goods, such as biofuels and building materials, for the low - carbon economy. Landshypotek Bank believes that lending to customers with a focus on sustainability reduces the long - term credit risk. A ccording to the bank , sustainability considerations or analyses are natural and integrated parts of the credit assessment since it can be difficult to separate sustainability considerations from the credit assessment in general. Under its regular lending policy, the bank requ ires forest management plans for forests a bove a certain size in order to understand and document the forest owners’ intentions and environmental profile. Forestry projects that are to be financed with green bonds issued under this framework need to comply with stricter requirements, a.o. in the form of an independently verified green forest management plan. These plans includ e minimum levels and targets for nature conservation and deciduous trees, which strengthen a forest’s resilience to extreme weather. According to the issuer, the green asset criteria set out in the framework represent stricter environmental standard s than what is required by Swedish law as eligible projects are either certified through the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certified (PEFC) , or in line with a certification by PEFC . Investments in forest management may entail the use, contracting or purchase of machinery running on fos sil fuels. We encourage the extension of the framework to record these emissions and to promote the use of biofuels in order to align forest management operations with the requirements of the future low carbon society. Based on the assessment of the projec t types , policies, goals and reporting standards, Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework receives a Dark Green shading. The framework includes both dark to medium - , medium - and dark green project categories. Given the bank’s ownership and longstanding st rategy, th e dark to medium green forestry projects will receive the major part of the proceeds of the initial green bond issuance under this framework.,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework 3 Contents Summary ________________________________ ________________________________ ______________________ 2 1 Introduction and background ________________________________ ________________________________ 4 2 Brief Description of Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework and rules and procedures for climate - related activities ________________________________ ________________________________ ___________ 6 Definition: ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 6 Selection: ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 7 Management of pro ceeds: ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ...... 7 Transparency and Accountability: ................................ ................................ ................................ ........................... 7 3 Assessment of Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond framework and environmental policies ___________ 11 Overall sha ding ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ..................... 11 Eligible projects under the Green Bond Framework ................................ ................................ .............................. 11 Strengths ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 13 Weaknesses ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................... 13 Pitfalls ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ... 13 Impacts beyond the project boundary ................................ ................................ ................................ ............ 13 Rebound effects ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ............ 14 Appendix: About CICERO ________________________________ ________________________________ ________ 15,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework 4 1 I ntroduction and background As an independent, not - for - profit, research institute, CICERO (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research - Oslo) provides Second Opinions on institutions’ framework and guidance for assessing and selecting eligible projects for green bond investments, and a ssesses the framework’s robustness in meeting the institutions’ environmental objectives. The Second Opinion is based on documentation of rules and frameworks provided by the institutions themselves (the client) and information gathered during meetings, te leconferences and e - mail correspondence with the client. CICERO is independent of the entity issuing the bond, its directors, senior management and advisers, and is remunerated in a way that prevents any conflicts of interests arising as a result of the fe e structure. CICERO has established the global Expert Network on Second Opinions (ENSO), a network of independent non - profit research institutions on climate change and other environmental issues, to broaden the technical expertise and regional experience for Second Opinions. CICERO works confidentially with other members in the network to enhance the links to climate and environmental science, building upon the CICERO model for Second Opinions. In addition to CICERO, ENSO members currently include Basque C enter for Climate Change (BC3), International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), and Tsinghua University's Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy. A more detailed description of CICERO can be found at the end of this report. ENSO encourages the client to make this Second Opinion publically available. If any part of the Second Opinion is quoted, the full report must be made available. CICERO’s Second Opinions are normally restricted to an evaluation of the mechanisms or framework for selecting eligible projects at a general level. CICERO does not validate or certify the climate effects of single projects, and thus, has no conflict of interest in regard to single projects. CICERO is neither responsible f or how the framework or mechanisms are implemented and followed up by the institutions, nor the outcome of investments in eligible projects. This note provides a Second Opinion of Landshypotek Bank Green Bonds Framework and policies for considering the env ironmental impacts of their projects. The aim is to assess the Landshypotek Bank Green Bonds Framework as to its ability to support Landshypotek Bank `s stated objective of promoting the transition to low - carbon and climate resilient growth. This Second Op inion is based on the green bond framework presented to CICERO by the issuer. Any amendments or updates to the framework require that CICERO undertake a new assessment. CICERO takes a long - term view on activities that support a low - carbon climate resilient society. In some cases, activities or technologies that reduce near - term emissions result in net emissions or prolonged use of high - emitting infrastructure in the long - run. CICERO strives to avoid locking - in of emissions through careful infrastructure inv estments, and moving towards low - or zero - emitting infrastructure in the long - run. Proceeds from green bonds may be used for financing, including refinancing, new or existing green projects as defined under the mechanisms or framework. CICERO assesses in t his Second Opinion the likeliness that the issuer's categories of projects will meet expectations for a low carbon and climate resilient future. Expressing concerns with ‘shades of green’ CICERO/ENSO Second Opinions are graded dark green, medium green or light green, reflecting the climate and environmental ambitions of the bonds and the robustness of the governance structure of the Green Bond,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework 5 Framework. The grading is based on a broad qual itative assessment of each project type, according to what extent it contributes to building a low - carbon and climate resilient society. The shading methodology also aims at providing transparency to investors when comparing green bond frameworks exposure to climate risks. A dark green project is less exposed to climate risks than a lighter green investment. This Second Opinion will allocate a ‘shade of green’ to the green bond framework of Landshypotek Bank : • Dark green for projects and solutions that are realizations today of the long - term vision of a low carbon and climate resilient future. Typically, this will entail zero emission solutions and governance structures that integrate environmental concerns into all activities. • Medium green for projects and solutions that represent steps towards the long - term vision, but are not quite there yet. • Light green for projects and solutions that are environmentally friendly but do not by themselves represent or is part of the long - term vision (e.g. energy efficienc y in fossil - based processes). • Brown for projects that are irrelevant or in opposition to the long - term vision of a low carbon and climate resilient future. The project types that will be financed by the green bond primarily define the overall grading. However, governance and transparency considerations are also important because they give an indication whether the institution that issues the green bond will be able to fulfil the climate and environmental ambitions of the investment framework. Investment s in all shades of green projects are necessary in order to successfully implement the ambition of the Paris agreement. The overall shading reflects an ambition of having the majority of the project types well represented in the future portfolio, unless ot herwise expressed by the issuer.,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework 6 2 Brief Description of Landshypotek Bank ’s Green Bond Framework and rules and procedures for climate - related activities Landshypotek Bank is a Swedish bank owned by 40.000 farmers and foresters across Sweden. The ba nk’s primary mandate is to provide financial services to the agricultural and forestry sectors. The vast majority of the loan portfolio is extended to these sectors and since 2017 the bank has also been active in the residential mortgage sector with a focu s on the areas outside the major cities in Sweden . Landshypotek Bank is of the opinion that lending to customers with a focus on sustainability reduces the long - term credit risk. According to the bank, sustainability considerations or analyses are natural and integrated parts of the credit assessment since it can be difficult to separate sustainability considerations from the credit assessment in general. Forestry projects that are to be financed with green bonds issued under this framework are required to provide green forest management plans. These plans include minimum levels and targets for nature conservation and deciduous trees, which strengthen a forest’s resilience to extreme weather. According to the issuer, the green asset criteria set out in the framework represent stricter environmental standards than what is required by Swedish law as eligible projects are either certified through the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certified (PEFC) or in line with a certification by PEFC. A green forest management plan ha s to be produced or verified by a certified 3 rd party expert. The issuer informed us that Landshypotek Bank is part of the Sustainability Group at the Swedish Bankers’ Association . In this working group, major Swedish banks discuss the adaptation to current and future climate risk and how climate scenarios could be used in risk analysis and credit assessment. Th e Sustainability Group has exchanges with a .o. the Swedish Ministry of Finance and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority on matters relating to sustainability and the financial market. Landshypotek Bank has confirmed that the bank has not been involved in any disputes with local communities or NGOs in recent times. Definition: Eligible projects fall within the categories sustainable forestry, renewable energy and green buildings. The bank summarizes the categories under “Green Assets”. Eligible projects can be financed or refinanced. Eligibilit y criteria for each category are derived from the relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The magnitude of the different SDGs depends on the key characteristics of a given project. The SDGs in question are: SDG 15 Life on Land, SDG 13 Climate Act ion, SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy. Green Bond net proceeds will not be allocated or linked to fossil energy generation, nuclear energy generation, research and/or development within weapons and defense , poten tially environmentally negative resource extraction (such as rare - earth elements or fossil fuels), gambling or tobacco. Landshypotek does not provide any loans to either of the above.,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework 7 The green bonds will, initially, largely refinance existing projects wit hin the categories under “Green Assets”. The bank aims to increase lending to new eligible projects . “New” includes projects that received lending up to 12 months prior to the issuance of a green bond . In this context, the bank forecasts that the allocatio n of green bond proceeds to such projects is likely to increase. Selection: Projects are evaluated and selected in a two - step process. First, Landshypotek Account Managers record data of every single loan. From this, a list of eligible projects in compl iance with the Green Asset Criteria is extracted. Second, the Green Bond Committee reviews this list of suggested loans and decides on the allocation of Green Bond proceeds. The Green Bond Committee consists of Chief Executive Officer, Head of Corporate Ba nking, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Sustainability Officer , and a Forest Expert. T he Green Bond Committee holds the right to exclude any green asset s already funded if eligibility is lost. Landshypotek Bank’s independent risk control department will undertake annual reviews of allocation of Green Bond net proceeds to ensure compliance with Landshypotek Bank’s green bond framework. A summary of the findings of the independent and internal ris k management department ’s annual control and review will be made available for bondholders, presumably through the website. Management of proceeds: An amount equal to the net proceeds will be credited to a separate account for Green Assets. Landshypotek Bank will keep this account separate from other accounts to ensure and enable separate monitoring and tracking. Unused proceeds on the separate account can temporarily be deposited with financial instituti ons or placed in debt securities issued by the Swedish government or Swedish municipalities, green bonds or covered bonds. The credit risk of such debt securities needs to have a minimum rating of AA - by an established rating agency. The issuer explicitly excludes investments in entities with a business strategy focused on nuclear or carbon dioxide intensive activities , weapons, defense, environmentally challenging extractive industries, gambling and tobacco. Transparency and Accountability: Landshypotek Bank will annually provide information to investors on their website. Reporting will include information on the share of refinanced and new projects. The reports will also provide information on Green Bond developments, the outstanding amounts of all types of issued green bonds, the balance of the separate account, the total aggregated proportion of Green Bond proceeds used per category, a summary of the independent and internal risk management review, and green asset reporting for each eligible project cat egory. Reporting will be provided on an aggregated basis and per project category for the entire green project portfolio. Once several bonds have been issued, the bank will strive to provide reporting per project category for each individual bond . Reports will include representative example projects, however, due to data protection considerations and the impractical amount of small projects and related data, the bank will not report on a project - by - project basis. The bank will report on greenhouse gas emissions absorbed by forests or avoided by green buildings and renewable energy installations based on aggregated figures per eligible category.,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework 8 The table below lists the documents that formed the basis for this Second Opinion: Table 1 .

The framework and procedures for Landshypotek Bank ’s green bond investment s are assessed and their strengths and weaknesses are discussed in this section. The strengths of an investment framework with respect to environmental impact are areas where it clearly supports low - carbon projects, whereas the weaknesses are typically are as that are unclear or too general. Pitfalls are also raised in this section to note areas where issuers should be aware of potential macro - level impacts of investment projects. Overall shading Based on the project category shadings detailed below, and con sideration of the issuer’s systematic sustainability work and governance structure of Landshypotek Bank in terms of management and use of proceeds, we rate the framework CICERO Dark Green. The framework includes both medium and dark green projects categori es. Given the bank’s ownership and longstanding strategy, the dark to medium green forestry projects will receive the major part of the proceeds of the initial green bond issuance under this framework. Eligible projects under the Green Bond Framework At th e basic level, the selection of eligible project categories is the primary mechanism to ensure that projects deliver environmental benefits. Through selection of project categories with clear environmental benefits, green bonds aim to provide certainty to investors that their investments deliver environmental returns as well as financial returns. The Green Bonds Principles (GBP) state that the “overall environmental profile” of a project should be assessed and that the selection process should be “well defi ned”. Category Eligible project types Green Shading and some concerns Sustainable forestry • Acquisition of forest land • Investments in sustainable forest management (e.g. planning, silviculture, fertilization, harvesting, roads, conservation) D ark to Medium Green • Investments in forest management may entail the use, contracting or purchase of machinery running on fossil fuels. We encourage the extension of the framework to record these emissions and to promote the use of biofuels in order to align fores t management,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework 12 operations with the requirements of the future low carbon society. • Investments in forest management may also enable car traffic through the construction of access roads. • The framework does not set any restrictions on the potential drainage of wetlands or harvesting of carbon rich peat in bogs beyond the Swedish Environmental Act, which requires permits for such activities. • Be aware of potential negative effects on biodiversity. Renewable energy • Development, construction, acquisition, installation of onshore wind farms in Sweden • Development, construction, acquisition, installation of solar PV power production units in Sweden Dark Green • C onsider life cycle emissions and emissions during constructi on • Be aware of negative effects on biodiversity Green buildings • Energy efficient buildings with EPC class A or B , equivalent to 50 or 25% improvement over building regulation • Energy efficient renovation reducing en ergy consumption by at least 30 % Medium Green • Building criteria are good, but not the best. In a 2050 perspective, the energy performance of buildings is expected to be improved, with zero emission houses becoming mainstream and the energy performance of existing buildings greatly improve d through refurbishments. Table 2 . Eligible project categories,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework 13 Strengths Sustainability integrated in credit assessment. The core activity of Landshypotek Bank has been and still is to provide financial services to forest owners who intend to operate their forests in a sustainable way . This means that the banks main exposure is to an asset class with time horizons spanning over multiple decades. It is thus encouraging to see that the bank has integrated sustainability into its credit assessment, since it connects to both, the long - term profitability of the assets and climate risk mitigation and adaptation. Measures to avoid deforestation and forest degradation are in place. The bank has internal systems to check the sustainability of assets. Each accoun t manager, as opposed to a central sustainability function, is required to apply the sustainability criteria. The issuer has a long track - reco rd on financing forestry assets. Sustainability requirements exceed Swedish law Forestry projects that are to be financed with green bonds issued under this framework need to provide a green forest management plan. These plans include minimum levels and targets for nature conservation and deciduous trees, which strengthen a forest’s resilience to extreme precipitatio n, droughts, storms and fires, according to the issuer. According to the issuer, the green asset criteria set out in the framework represent stricter environmental standards than what is required by Swedish law as eligible projects are either certified thr ough the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certified (PEFC) or in line with a certification by PEFC. A green forest management plan has to be produced or verified by a certified 3 rd party expert. Sustainable fo restry is part of a low carbon future economy Forests is an important element in the low - carbon and climate resilient society . Avoiding deforestation and forest degradation combined with afforestation will play a role in reducing CO2 emissions and sequeste ring carbon to counterbalance emissions from other sources. The two most common approaches of utilizing forests in a climate perspective are to protect them and sequester carbon that way or managing the forests sustainably, which will provide raw materials and goods, such as biofuels and building materials, for the low - carbon economy. Such bio fuels and materials can replace fossil based fuels and materials. Reporting and transparency The company has clear guidelines for the management of the green bond proceeds. Landshypotek Bank will report on various indicators of projects financed by the green bond proceeds. These reports will be available to both investors and the public. The bank will report on both green indicators e.g. installed capacity of renewa ble energy and annual energy savings from building projects as well as greenhouse gas emissions absorbed by forests or avoided by green buildings and renewable energy installations based on aggregated figures per eligible category. Weaknesses There are no apparent weaknesses in Landshypotek Bank’s framework. Pitfalls The financed forestry projects may potentially lead to degraded forests and carbon emissions if green asset criteria and standards are not followed.,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework 14 Sustainable forest management operations, such as thinning, logging, and transport, requires machinery. Investments in forest management may entail the use, contracting or purchase of mac hinery running on fossil fuels, creating climate gas emissions. The current practice is not in line with the lo w carbon society. The issuer informed us that data on emissions from such operations are currently not available. We encourage Landshypotek Bank to be aware of this source of climate gas emissions and to exten d the framework to record these emissions and t o promote the use of biofuels in order to align forest management operations with the requirements of the future low carbon society. We do note that felling is subject to regulations that consider local environmental impacts, such as the required use of bi o - oils in hydraulic systems of machinery. Forest management may require the construction of roads to give access to felling sites and are needed, a.o. for the transportation of logs. The issuer informed us that these roads under Swedish law are open to pub lic use. The issuer also informed us that these are gravel roads and that the primary purpose is not the facilitation of public traffic. The framework does not explicitly rule out that green bond proceeds may be used to finance the drainage of wetlands and activities connected to carbon - rich peat. The issuer informed us that financing these activities is not the purpose of the framework. The issuer also informed us that such activities are regulated by Swedish environmental law and require obtaining a permi t. When the bank reports on greenhouse gas emissions absorbed by forests we encourage the issuer to also record and report emissions from land use change, e.g. if a wetland is drained to construct an access road, and emissions from the use of machinery. Impacts beyond the project boundary Due to the complexity of how socio - economic activities impact the climate, a specific project is likely to have interactions with the broader community beyond the project borders. These interactions may or may not be c limate - friendly, and thus need to be considered with regards to the net impact of climate - related investments. Rebound effects Efficiency improvements may lead to rebound effects. When the cost of an activity is reduced there will be incentives to do more of the same activity. Landshypotek Bank should be aware of such effects and possibly avoid Green Bond funding of projects where the risk of rebound effects is particularly high.,C ICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Landshypotek Bank’s Green Bond Framework 15 Appendix: About CICERO CICERO Center for International Climate Research is Norway’s foremost institute for interdisciplinary climate research. We deliver new insight that helps solve the climate challen ge and strengthen inter - national climate cooperation. We collaborate with top researchers from around the world and publish in recognized international journals, reports, books and periodicals. CICERO has garnered particular attention for its work on the e ffects of manmade emissions on the climate and the formulation of international agreements and has played an active role in the UN’s IPCC since 1995. CICERO is internationally recognized as a leading provider of independent reviews of green bonds, since t he market’s inception in 2008. CICERO received a Green Bond Award from Climate Bonds Initiative for being the biggest second opinion provider in 2016 and from Environmental Finance for being the best external review provider (2017). CICERO Second Opinions are graded dark green, medium green and light green to offer investors better insight in the environmental quality of green bonds. The shading, introduced in spring 2015, reflects the climate and environmental ambitions of the bonds in the light of the tr ansition to a low - carbon society. CICERO works with both international and domestic issuers, drawing on the global expertise of the Expert Network on Second Opinions. Led by CICERO, ENSO is comprised of trusted research institutions and reputable experts on climate change and other environmental issues, including the Basque Center for Climate Change (BC3), the Stockholm Environment Institute, the Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy at Tsinghua University and the International Institute for Sustain able Development (IISD).
