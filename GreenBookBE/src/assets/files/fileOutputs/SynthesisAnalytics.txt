Synthesis Analytics has developed the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework (the “ F ramework ”) under which i t intends to iss ue multiple green bon d s through the special - purpose vehicle, Sustainable Capital Plc , and use the proceeds t o finance and/or refinance , in whole or in part , existing and/ or future projects that aim to improve the efficiency of HPC centres . The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in the following areas: 1. Renewable Energy 2. Green Digital Solutions 3. Energy Efficiency 4. Green Buildings Synthesis Analytics engaged Sustainalytics to review the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework , dated May 2020 , and provide a second - party opinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) . 1 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 2 Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent 3 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • T he Framework’s al ignment with the ICMA Green Bond Principles 2018 • The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds • The alignment of the issuer’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proc eeds For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.3.1 , which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversa tions with various members of Synthesi s ’ management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Synthesis representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of Synthesis to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. Any update of the present Second - Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and Synthesis Analytics . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framewo rk with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be fin anced with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - soci al - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ . 2 The Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework is available on Synthesis Analytics’ website at: www.synthesis.se/greenbondframework 3 When op erating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustainalytic s and ensuring analyst independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in p lace a robust conflict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consistency of process, structural separation of commercial an d research (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparency.,Second - Party Opinion Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework 3 In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the intended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a s tatement, representation, warrant or argument either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that Synthesis has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this SPO. Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework aligns with the four core components of the GBP 201 8 . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Synthesis ’ G reen B ond F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible categor ies Renewable Energy , Green Digital Solutions , Energy Efficiency and Green Buildings are aligned with those recognized by the GBP . Projects financed will aim to provid e energy efficient HPC cent re solutions , with a focus on the Swedish market. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that energy efficient HPC centers can reduce overall energy consumption and provide opportunities for capturing waste heat. - Renewable E nergy financing may include the development, construction , maintenance and operation of wind or solar energy as well as the procurement of renewable energy through long - term Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) . Sustainalytics positively views these expenditures and notes that, for the first issuance, this categor y makes up the bulk of expenditures . - Green Digital Solutions may include research and development (“R&D”) expenditures for the depl oyment of systems, products and technology that increase energy efficiency including development of energy efficient micro - ar chitecture components, optimize d algorithms and hardware, data analytics and cloud products and solutions. Sustainalytics recognizes that R&D activities have the potential to result in positive environmental outcomes, while also no ting that it is very difficult to quantify the impacts of R&D related activities until commercialization . Sustainaly tics encourages Synthesis to report on estimated or achieved energy efficiency savings , on a portfolio basis, where feasible. - Energy Efficiency expenditures may include the development of energy efficient electronic equi pment, improved cooling solutions, e nergy capture 4 and reuse , energy storage systems and the consolidation/optimization of HPC centers for the purpose of increasing energy efficiency. For example, this includes the production and deployment of energy efficient Integrated Computing Units (ICUs) which can reduce the energy used for each unit of work by 20 - 30% compared to a traditional data center . Additionally, expenditures may be allocated to the installation o f immersion cooling system s tha t serve to both improve cooling and captu re waste - heat. Similarly, the deployment of systems to capture waste - heat f rom HPCs for use in district heating ( “D H ” ) may be financed. Sustainalytics positively views reuse of waste - heat and improvements in energy efficiency and encourages the Issuer to r eport on estimated or achieved energy efficiency savings /total amount of waste - heat generated , on a portfolio basis, where feasible. - Green Building expenditures may include the development, acquisition, leasing or renovation of commercial buildings that have obtained one of the following certifications: BREEAM “Excellent” or above; LEED “Gold” or above; BCA Green mark “Gold” or above; CEEDA “Gold” or above or other equivalent standards. Susta inalytics positively views the establishment of minimum certification levels and recognizes these levels as commensurate with best practice. For Sustainalytics assessment of these schemes, please refer to Appendix 1. - Sustainalytics notes that the Issuer ha s set a 24 - month lookback period. 4 Capturing the energy of waste - heat.,Second - Party Opinion Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework 4 • P roject Evaluation and Selection: - Synthesis Analytics’ Board of Directors are responsible for ensuring that potentially eligible projects are screened against the Framework’s eligibility criteria before being selected fo r allocation. Synthesis’ B oard is also responsible for ensuring the ongoing eligibility of selected projects over the duration of the bond. The Board meets annually to determine continued eligibility and/or select new projects as needed. - Sustainalytics con side rs this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - The management of proceeds are handled by the financial management team from the financial department . Proceeds are monitored and tracked via an internal accounting system and are allocated to eligible projects on a portfolio basis . Pending full allocation, unallocated proceeds may be held in cash, cash equivalents or other short - term liquid instruments . - Based o n these elements, Sustainalytics conside rs this process t o be in line with market practice. • Reporting: - Synthesis Analytics will provide allocation reporting annually, on its website, until full allocation of the bond. The allocation report will include the total amount of allocation and a corresponding list/desc ription of the eligible projects as well as the balance of unallocated proceeds, if any. Regarding impact reporting, Synthesis Analytics is committed to reporting on relevant impact metrics, for a complete list of potential indicators please see Appendix 2 . Sustainalytics positively notes that Synthesis Analytics intends to seek third - party auditing for its allocation reporting. - Based on these elements, Sustainalytics views this process as aligned with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP 201 8 . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 2 : Green Bond/Green Bond Program me External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of Synthesis Contribution of framework to Synthesis Analytics’ sustainability mission Synthesis Analytics ’ Framework is aligned with its mission to contribute to sustainable computing through the application of green and circular systems. 5 The Company has set a target to produce 2 - 2.5 GW of waste - heat to district heating networks in Sweden by 2030. Sustainalytics notes that Synthesis Analytics is still at the initial launch of its business and has not yet released a sustainability strategy . Nonetheless, Sustainalytics encourages Synthesis Analytics to develop a sustainability strategy with additional quantitative, time - bound targets. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Synthe sis Analytics Green Bond Framework will contribute towards the Company’s overall mission of contributing to sustainable computing , while noting that a lack of a sustainability strategy is perceived as a weakness . Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects Sustainalytics acknowledges that the Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that have positive environmental impact. However, Sustainalytics is awa re that such eligible projects could lead to negative environmental and social outcomes . Some key environmental and social risks associated with the eligible projects, could include occupational health and safety and land use change. Sustainalytics is of t he opinion that these risks will be mitigated through the following regulations : • Sweden’s Environmental Code requires an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for activities that are likely to have a significant environmental impact. As part of the EIA , th e pursuant shall hold consultations with government agencies, municipalities, citizens and organizations that are likely to be affected. 6 5 Synthesis Analytics, “Synthesis Analytics - High Performa nce Green Computing for the Future”, at: https://www.synthesis.se/ 6 Kingdom of Sweden, “ Environmental Code ”, (1998), at: https://www.government.se/contentassets/be5e4d4ebdb4499f8d6365720ae68724/the - swedish - environmental - code - ds - 200061,Second - Party Opinion Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework 5 • The Swedish Work Environment Authority (SWEA) issue s provisions designating employer responsibility to preve nt ill health and accidents, and to create a good working environment . 7 The SWEA ’s Statute Book detail s regulations about , inter alia, the transport of material at construction sites, roof work, and safety nets , f irst aid and crisis support , e rgonomics for the p revention of m usculoskeletal d isorders , that aim to reduce the occupational hazard . 8 • Sweden is classified as a “Designated C ountry” under the Equator Principles, i ndicating the presence of robust environment and social governance systems , legislation, and institutional capacity for protecting the environment and communities. 9 Based on the above , Sustainalytics is of the opinio n that the potential risks associated with Synthesis Analytics ’ activities in Sweden can be mitigated. However, Sustainalytics notes that Synthesis Analytics does not have any publicly available risk management policies , which is viewed as a shortcoming. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All five use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP. Sustainalyt ics discusses below where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context Increasing energy efficiency through HPC centres From 2015 to 2020, the IT sector ’s energy consumption increased by approximately 9% per year , while GHG emissions increased by approximately 8% per year. 10 In 2020, the IT sector is expected to be responsible for about 4% of global GHG emissions and for approximately 3.3. % of the world’s energy consumption . 10 Data centers alone are estimated to be responsible for 19% of the sector ’s energy consumption, highlighting their contribution to the sector’s environmental footprint. 10 Moreove r, the total energy consumption of data centers doubles every four years, which means that their carbon footprint is the fastest growing in the IT sector. 11 This is primarily due to (i) the growth in data traffic, (ii) the growth in volume of data to be stored and (iii) the growth in the volume of operations. 10 In Sweden, the government has establishe d a long term goal of net - zero GHG by 2045 , and HPC centers offer an opportunity for increasing energy efficiency and reducing overall GHG emissions. HPC centers , which are more energy efficient than traditional data centers , can help to offset the energy consumption and enable energy savings . Data centers use 40 - 60% additional energy above the energy expended to run the equipment doing the actual useful work , while HPC centers use less than 2% additional energy for cooling and operations. 12 Thus, the PUE of centers is estimated at 1.02, which is considered “very efficient.” 13 Energy efficiency in HPC is influenced by four main elements , (i) building infrastructure, (ii) system hardware, (iii) system software and (iv) applications. 14 The HPC activities financed from this Framework categories could help the Synthesis Analytics improv e energy efficiency in the four main elements. For instance, optimized algorithms, data analytics and cloud products and solutions could improve the efficiency of system software. Sustainalyti cs i s of the opinion that financed projects can contribut e to reduc ing the environmental impacts of HPC systems by improving their energy efficiency and help Sweden meet its 2045 net - zero GHG target. Alignment with/ contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030.

Sustainable Cities & Communities 11.6 By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita envir onmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management Conclusion Synthesis Analytics has developed the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework under which it will issue green bonds and the use of proceeds to finance HPC centres and provide green computing products and solutions that improve energy efficiency, reduce waste and capture waste - heat. Sustainalytics considers that the projec ts funded by the green bond proceeds will provide positive environmental impact . The Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proce eds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use of procee ds categor ies will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustai nable Development Goa l s 7 & 11 . Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Synthesis has sufficient measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proc eeds. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Synthesis Analytics is well - positioned to issue green bonds and that th e Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018.,Second - Party Opinion Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework 7 Appendices Appendix 1: Green Bond / Green Bond Programme - External Review Form LEED Singapore BCA Green Mark BREEAM Background Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a US Certification System for residential and commercial buildings used worldwide. LEED was developed by the non - profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and covers the design, construction, maintenance and operation of buildings. The BCA Green Mark Scheme provides real estate certif ications in Singapore to promote sustainability in the built environment (during project conceptualisation and design, as well as during construction.) 15 BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) was first published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in 1990. Based in the UK. Used for new, refurbished and extension of existing buildings.

Each rating system is designed to apply to a specific sector (e.g. New Construction, Major Renovation, Core and Shell Development, Schools - /Retail - /Healthcare New Construction and Major Renovations, Existing Buildings: Operation and Maintenance). Performance Areas have diffe rent weights. 16 Depending on the level of building performance and numerical score achieved in performance area, building’s level of certification is determined. Assessment of compliance with Green Mark criteria is done by the Singapore Building and Co nstruction Authority (BCA). which is based on the overall score obtained (expressed as a percentage). Majority of BREEAM issues are flexible, meaning that the client can choose which to comply with to build their BREEAM performance score. BREAAM has two stages/ audit reports: a ‘BR EEAM Design Stage’ and a ‘Post Construction Stage’, with different assessment criteria.

Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluatio n of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental cri teria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. A ssurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certificat ion: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria,,Second - Party Opinion Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework 14 and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or asse ssed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or anothe r benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework 15 Disclaimer Copyright ©2020 Sustainalytics.
