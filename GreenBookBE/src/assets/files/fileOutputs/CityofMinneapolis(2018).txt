Review overview SCOPE OF REVIEW The review assessed the following elements and confirmed their alignment with the GBPs: ☒ Use of Proceeds ☒ Process for Project Evaluation and Selection ☒ Management of Proceeds ☒ Reporting ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL REVIEW PROVIDER ☒ Second Party Opinion ☐ Certification ☐ Verification ☐ Scoring/ Rating ☐ Other (please specify): EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF REVIEW Proceeds from the City of Minneapolis’ General Obligation Capital Improvement Bonds, Series 2018 are 100% dedicated towards environmental sustainably-oriented activities consistent with the Green Bond Principles, Green Buildings category. Bond proceeds will be used for the New Public Service Center and the Eastside Storage and Maintenance Facility. The City of Minneapolis has established a low carbon trajectory, and proceeds of the bonds are aligned with this trajectory. The New Public Service Center and the Eastside Storage and Maintenance Facility Project are both designed to achieve LEED Gold or higher certification. The Eastside Storage and Maintenance Facility is also designed to achieve 30% energy savings under LEED version 3, based on the scorecard provided. The LEED Gold strategies for Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency,,Page 2 of 6 Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, and Indoor Environmental Quality infer the Carbon Intensity Target of target 35.52 kgCO2/sqm p.a. to align with the Paris Climate Agreement will be met. The New Public Service Center complies with the LEED v4 Gold Certification requirement. An energy savings of 20% is documented. The Energy Model was not yet completed at the time of this opinion. The Energy Model will show the comprehensive energy savings of the building, and it is reasonable to expect a minimum of 10% additional energy savings when passive daylighting, ventilation and envelope strategies as well as efficient lighting, HVAC and possible control systems are taken into consideration. These strategies could easily achieve the target for both the Proxy and Path 3 option as per the Climate Bonds Initiative criteria. Both buildings have numerous additional features that contribute to environmental sustainability. The New Public Service Center is close to mass transit, and consolidates several City departments under one roof, eliminating many trips associated with employees and citizens traveling from place to place. The design of the New Public Service Center emphasizes natural daylighting, energy efficiency, indoor air quality and public art. The Eastside Storage and Maintenance Facility will showcase innovative stormwater management best practices to serve as an example for other organizations to follow. Section 3. Detailed review Reviewers are encouraged to provide the information below to the extent possible and use the comment section to explain the scope of their review. 1. USE OF PROCEEDS Overall comment on section: The City of Minneapolis will use the green bond proceeds for buildings that demonstrate energy efficiency metrics at above-market performance. Building ratings systems such as LEED, attest to the Energy & Atmosphere and Innovation attributes of projects. Energy efficient building projects built to LEED standards can positively impact carbon emissions, ozone depletion, mineral extraction, air quality, human health and infrastructure needs. Therefore, LEED-certified buildings meet the GBP Energy Efficiency criteria. The calculated carbon intensity target is 35.52 kgCO2/sqm per annum assuming a bond term of approximately 15 years. To achieve this target, the buildings must show a minimum 30% energy savings (reduction) compared to the ASHRAE 90.1 baseline. The New Public Service Center and the Eastside Storage and Maintenance Facility Project are both designed to achieve LEED Gold or higher certification. Eastside Storage and Maintenance Facility The Eastside Storage and Maintenance Facility Project will be used by the City Public Works Department to combine the operations of several of its divisions together under one roof. The new facility will improve operational and energy efficiency, accommodate all Solid Waste and Recycling staff at one location, and allow the Solid Waste and Recycling Division to expand service to include organics collection. The project will showcase innovative stormwater management best practices to serve as an example for other organizations to follow. This project is registered under LEED version 3, 2009, and is designed to achieve LEED Gold Certification, and 30% Energy savings under LEED version 3. According to the LEEDv3 Scorecard, the project meets a threshold of 30% energy cost savings with the 10 points earned for EA credit 1: Optimize Energy Performance compared to ASHRAE 90.1, 2007. It also exceeds the 60 point minimum threshold for LEED Gold. This project is designed to meet the calculated carbon intensity target for the City of Minneapolis. The f acility will also include public art and green space, and sustainable components such recycled building materials and solar panels. New Public Service Center This project is registered under LEED version 4, 2013, and Complies with LEEDv4 Gold Certification Requirement. The LEEDv4 scorecard provided shows 8 “yes” points for Energy and Atmosphere credit 2: Optimize Energy Performance, which indicates 20% energy cost reduction compared to ASHRAE 90.1, 2010.,Page 3 of 6 The Energy Model was not complete at the time of the scorecard, however, the passive daylighting, ventilation, envelope strategies, lighting, HVAC and control systems indicate that additional energy savings could be easily achieved.

PROCESS FOR PROJECT EVALUATION AND SELECTION Overall comment on section (if applicable) : The City utilizes a robust and transparent annual process to prioritize capital improvements for financing. The Five-Year Capital Improvement Plan for the City of Minneapolis beginning with the 2015 – 2019 cycle and including the 2019 – 2023 cycle under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 475 dated March 23, 2018, identified the Eastside Storage and Maintenance Facility and the New Public Service Center as a priority for bond financing. The City has not previously issued green bonds, and this is the City’s first Green Bond Framework. Green buildings, also known as low-carbon buildings, are an eligible project type under the Green Bond Principles. In 2015, Mayor Betsy Hodges signed the Compact of Mayors, the world’s largest cooperative effort among mayors and city officials to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, track progress, and prepare for the impacts of climate change. Minneapolis is one of 17 cities across nine nations that joined to launch the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, a collaboration of global cities committed to reducing greenhouse gas pollution by 80 percent or more by 2050 or sooner. The Minneapolis Climate Action Plan sets a goal of achieving a 1.5 percent annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from City facilities. Another goal is to ensure that City facilities and infrastructure, across all neighborhoods, are models of energy efficiency and renewable energy technology.

For more information, visit www.kestrelverifiers.com ABOUT ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP 1. Second Party Opinion : An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. 2. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. 3. Certification : An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. 4. Green Bond Scoring/Rating : An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2-degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.
