C O M / E S G 3 o f 2 3 Overall Evaluation of the Green Bond Deutsche Bank AG (Deutsche Bank) commissioned ISS ESG to assist with its Green Bond by assessing th ree core elements to determine the sustainability quality of the Bond: 1. Deutsche Bank’s Green Bond framework – benchmarked against the International Capital Market Association 's ( ICMA ) Green Bond Principles ( G BPs ). 2. The asset pool – whether the projects aligned with ISS ESG ’s issue - specific key performance indicators (KPIs) (See Annex 2 ). 3. Deutsche Bank’s sustainability performance, according to the ISS ESG C orporate R ating. ISS ESG ASSESSMENT SUMMARY 1 ISS E SG ’s evaluation will remain valid until any modification of the Green Bond Framework or addition of new assets into the asset pool by the issuer and as long as the Corporate Rating does not cha nge (last modification on the 24.03 . 20 20). The controversy chec k of the underlying assets was conducted on the 16.03. 20 20. 2 Rank relative to industry group. 1 indicates a high relative ESG performance, while 10 indicates a low relative ESG performan ce. SPO SECTION SUMMARY EVALUATION 1 Part 1: Performance against GBPs The issuer has defined a formal concept for its Green Bonds regarding use of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and repo rting. This concept is in line with the ICMA GBPs. Positive Part 2: Sustainability quality of the asset pool The overall sustainability quality of the asset pool in terms of sustainability benefit s, risk avoidance and minimisation is good based upon the ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs. The Green Bond KPIs contain a clear description of eligible asset categories which include : sola r energy, wind energy, biomass and energy efficiency (LED lighting) . The use of proceeds categories included in the asset pool have a significant contribution for some, and limited contribution for others to SDGs 7 ‘Affordable and clean energy’ and 13 ‘Climate action’. The environmental and social risks associated with those assets have been well managed. Positive Part 3: Issuer susta inability performance The issuer itself shows a medium sustainability performance and has been given a rating of C, which classifies it as ‘Prime’ by the methodology of the ISS ESG Corporate Rating . It is rated 6 th out of 285 companies within its sector as of 16 . 04 .2020 . This equates to a high relative performance, with a Decile Rank 2 of 1 .

C O M / E S G 4 o f 2 3 Contribution of the Green Bond to the UN SDGs Based on the assessment of the sustainability quality of the green bond asset poo l and using a proprietary methodology, ISS ESG assessed the contribution of the Deutsche Bank’s green bond to the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations (UN SDGs). This assessment is displayed on 5 - point scale (see Annex 2 for methodo logy): Significant Obstruction Limited Obstruction No Net Impact Limited Contribution Significant Contribution Each of the bond’ s Use of Proceeds categories has been assessed for its contribution to, or obstruction of, the SDGs: USE OF PROCEEDS CONTRIBU TION OR OBSTRUCTION SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS Wind Energy Significant contribution Solar Energy Significant contribution Biomass Limited Contribution Energy efficiency Limited Contribution,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 5 o f 2 3 ISS ESG SPO ASSESSMENT PART I : GREEN BOND PRINCIPLES 1. Use of Proceeds An amount corresponding to the net proceeds from any Green Bond issued under the Framework shall be used to finance Deutsche Bank’s Green Asset Pool (the Green Asset Pool). The pool is composed of both loans t o and investments in corporations, assets or projects, which support s the transition to a clean, energy - efficient and environmentally sustainable global economy and are in line with the requirements of this Framework (Eligible Green Assets). Deutsche Bank commits on a best efforts basis to reach full allocation within one year following each Green Bond issuance. In order to be eligible for inclusion in the Green Asset Pool, the loan or investment must fall in at least one of the sectors described in the tab le below (Eligible Sectors). In case of general corporate loans, at least 90% of the turnover of the corporation needs to be attributable to Eligible Sectors and fulfil the respective requirements. In addition to outlining the required eligibility criteria , the table below also maps the Eligible Sectors to the relevant GBP category and the SDGs. GBP CATEGORY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA SHARE OF THE ASSET POOL RenewableEnergy Loans or investments in corporations, assets or proje cts related to renewable energy pro jects, including, but not limited to, wind (onshore/offshore), solar (photovoltaic/concent rated solar power) and biomass . Eligibility requirements under current version of the EU Taxonomy to be considered: - Asset / Project loans: Over - arching, technology - agnostic emissions threshold of 100g CO2e / KWh declining to 0gCO 2 e/kWh by 2050 for all sorts of electricity production (life cycle impact for producing 1 kWh of electricity) - Biomass specific: facilities operating above 80 % of GHG emissions - reduction in relation to the relative fossil fuel comparator set out in RED II increasing to 100% by 2050 93.7 % EnergyEfficiency Loans or investments in corporations, assets or projects related to the development and implementation of products or technology that red uce the use of energy. Examples include but are not limited to: energy efficient lighting (e.g. LEDs), energy storage (e.g. fuel cells), improvement in energy services (e.g. smart grid meters). Eligibility requirements under current version of the EU Taxon omy to be considered: - Energy efficiency is mentioned across various activities, as such no general threshold can be applied, and decisions need to be made on a case - by - case basis depending on the sector and activity specific background 6.3 %,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 6 o f 2 3 GreenBuild ings Loans or investments in assets or projects related to the construction of new buildings, operation of existing buildings or renovation of existing buildings (with a minimum energy efficiency upgrade) in the commercial real estate sector. Construction of new commercial buildings which meet at least one of the following criteria: - Certification with a minimum of LEED “Gold”, BREEAM “Very Good”, or where needed, any other certification that is comparable to the above thresholds - Buildings in the top 15 % of low carbon buildings in the respective country (if benchmarks exist) Renovation of existing buildings which meet the following criteria: - Energy savings of at least 30% in comparison to the baseline performance of the building before the renovation B uildings that are used for the purpose of occupation by fossil fuel extraction or manufacturing of fossil fuel activities are explicitly excluded. Eligibility requirements under current version of the EU Taxonomy to be considered: - New buildings (initiall y): net primary energy demand of the new construction must be at least 20% lower than the primary energy demand resulting from the relevant ‘nearly zero - energy building’ requirements. - Renovation: when compliant with energy performance standards set in th e applicable building regulations for major renovations transposing the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, or achieving energy savings of at least 30% in comparison to the baseline performance of the building before the renovation Exclusions Deu tsche Bank explicitly excludes non - committed or non - performing exposures, as well as loans to businesses or projects that are involved in the following operations from being eligible for the Green Asset Pool: • Activities related to the exploration and produ ction of fossil fuels • Nuclear and nuclear related technologies • Weapons, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and adult entertainment • Deforestation and degradation of forests In addition to the requirements specific to the Eligible Sectors, all loans originated by D eutsche Bank that are potentially eligible for inclusion in the Green Asset Pool are tested against the bank’s Environmental and Social Policy Framework (ES Policy Framework). The ES Policy Framework evaluates potential environmental and social risks that could arise from transactions or interactions with clients, and with specific principles and guidelines determine the best course of action.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 7 o f 2 3 Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Use of Proceeds description provided by Deutsche Bank’s Green Bond Framework aligned with the G BPs and with the Technical Screening Criteria defined by the EU Taxonomy 3 . Environmental benefits are defined and described . Additionally, the sustainability objectives defined in the framework align with the sustainability strategy of the issue r. 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection To identify Eligible Green Assets that are in line with the Eligible Sectors and related criteria defined in the “Use of proceeds” section, Deutsche Bank follows a three - step process: i. green asset screen ing and pre - selection, ii. internal validation, and iii. external verification. Step 1: Green asset screening and pre - selection For each of the Eligible Sectors, Deutsche Bank has put in place category - specific selection criteria that are used by the resp ective originating business areas to identify eligible items in their portfolio. The selection criteria are in accordance with conditions outlined in section 2.2 Use of proceeds and might be extended by the currently still evolving criteria around the do - n o - significant - harm assessment as proposed through the EU Taxonomy in the future. Step 2: Internal validation Assets that are pre - selected through the respective originating business areas subsequently need to be validated by the Deutsche Bank Green Bond Fo rum (the Forum). The Forum acts to ensure compliance of pre - selected assets with the Framework and has full discretion to object to the inclusion of any asset, ultimately blocking them from being included in the Green Asset Pool in case of relevant concern s. The Forum consists of selected representatives from Group Sustainability, Treasury and Origination/Front Office and convenes in at least quarterly intervals to vote unanimously on the inclusion of newly added green assets, as well as potential adjustmen ts to the Framework’s selection criteria. Potential future changes of the framework’s selection criteria will not affect the treatment of Eligible Green Assets retroactively, i.e. Eligible Green Assets that went successfully through the pre - selection and v alidation steps will not be affected by ex - ante framework changes and will remain in the Green Asset Pool. Ex - post removal (other than through maturity or sale of the asset) or substitution of assets from the Green Asset Pool is generally possible if new i nformation concerning Eligible Green Assets emerge which warrant their removal from the Green Asset Pool. A process for such removal will also be overseen by the Forum, again requiring unanimous voting by its members before any actions are permitted. Step 3: External verification A reputable verifier is mandated to evaluate on an annual basis the compliance of the Green Asset Pool with the requirements set by this Framework. Any issue regarding one or multiple green assets in the pool raised by the verifier in this process can lead to the ex - ante exclusion of the respective asset(s), following the exclusion process through the Green Bond Forum as described in step two. Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Process for P roject Evaluation and Selection provided by De utsche Bank’s Green Bond Framework as aligned with the GBPs . Deutsche Bank has a documented step by 3 According to the Taxonomy Technical Report as of March 2020.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 8 o f 2 3 step process to determine that projects fit within defined categories. Additionally, assets need to be validated by the Deutsche Bank Green Bond Forum to en sure compliance of pre - selected assets with the Framework, reflecting best market practice. 3. Management of Proceeds An amount corresponding to the net proceeds of any Green Bond issued by Deutsche Bank under the Framework, irrespective of the legal form o f the instrument, will be used to finance Deutsche Bank’s Green Asset Pool. The Eligible Green Assets stem from all different Eligible Sectors as defined in section 2.2 Use of proceeds, subject to the asset selection and evaluation process. The Green Asset Pool is expected to grow in size over time as further sectors are added to the Framework. Eligible Green Assets selected and validated by the Forum are documented in the Deutsche Bank Green Asset Inventory (the Inventory), which represents the technical m apping of the Green Asset Pool. The Inventory is populated based on information provided by all parties involved in the asset selection process . Flagging assets to be documented in the Inventory is a mere designation and does not imply any change in owners hip, pledge or lien for benefit of third parties or change in assignment to legal entity, branch or division. Deutsche Bank strives, at any point in time, to maintain a larger total amount of Eligible Green Assets than the total net proceeds of all green b onds outstanding. To maintain a buffer of Eligible Green Assets in the Inventory over green bond net proceeds, Deutsche Bank is dedicat ed to substitute maturing loans or other financings with an ap propriate alternative as timely as practically possi ble. Th e Inventory is routinely monitored by D eutsche Bank’s Treasury unit to detect potential shortfalls. Should a shortfall occur, Treasury will d irect , at its own discret ion, the shortfall amount towards its liquidity portfolio, consisting of cash and/or cash equivalents, and/or other liquid marketable instruments. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that Management of Proceeds proposed by Deutsche Bank aligns with the GBPs , as Deuts che Bank strives to maintain a larger total amount of eligible green assets than the total n et proceeds of all green bonds outstanding. Additionally, the issuer commits to reach full allocation within one year after issuing, reflecting best market practice. 4. Reporting As long as there is any Green Bond outstanding, Deutsche Bank is committed to p ublish relevant information and documents regarding our Green Bond activities in a dedicated Green Bond Report, whi ch will be made available on the investor relation website on an annual basis 4 . The report is split in two parts (i) the allocation reportin g and (ii) the impact reporting, whereby each report will contain details including, but not limited to: 4 www.db.com/ir/,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 9 o f 2 3 Allocation reporting • Confirmation that the use of proceeds of Green Bonds outstanding are in alignment with the eligibility criteria set by the Fram ework • The total amount of outstanding Green bonds and the share of proceeds used for financing or re - financing purposes • The amount of net proceeds allocated within each Eligible Sector, as well as the balance of net proceeds not yet allocated to Eligible Green Assets (if any) • Illustrative examples describing Eligible Green Assets to which Green Bond net proceeds have been allocated, which are subject to confidentiality commitments to clients Impact reporting Subject to feasibility and data availability, t he impact reporting will focus on the following information: • Asset - specific results (where possible) and related environmental impact indicators (such as CO CO2 emissions avoided) • Asset category aggregated results and related environmental impact indicato rs (such as CO2 emissions avoided) An overview of selected impact indicators for the respective categories to be financ ed are outlined in the appendix of the Framework. In case other Eligible Sectors will be added in the future, the Framework update would also include the addition of the respective impact reporting indicators for those asset categories. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the reporting proposed by Deutsche Bank Green Bond Framework is in line with the GBPs . Deutsche Bank is transparent on the expec ted level of use of proceeds reporting and has defined clear targets for its impact reporting. External review The Second Party Opinion will be made available on Deutsche Bank’s investor relations webpage 5 . In order to ensure sustained compliance of all issued bonds with the methodology set out in this Framework, Deutsche Bank will further appoint ISS Corporate Solutions or any other party as successor for ISS Corporate Solutions as an annual verifier. 5 www.db.com/ir/,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

In 2018, total ESG related assets under management, encompassing a broad range from lenient to strict approaches, amounted to EUR 47.1 billion. This included ESG and sustainable assets under management, real estate investments in certified green-labeled buildings, as well as infrastructure assets in renewable assets, representing about 7% of total assets under management. Furthermore, Deutsche Bank has a long-standing tradition of supporting micro-entrepreneurs. In addition, during 2018, Deutsche Bank fully or partially arranged EUR 1.2 billion in project finance to renewable energy projects. However, these products and activities do not constitute a major business for Deutsche Bank. In the financial sector, the main sustainability challenges are in the lending and investment banking as well as asset management businesses. Deutsche Bank has implemented an environmental and social policy framework addressing corporate finance, including project finance, trade finance and investment banking. Deutsche Bank will not finance e.g. activities and/or clients that use child or forced labour; projects or activities located in or involving the clearing of primary tropical moist forests, illegal logging or uncontrolled and/or illegal use of fire; or activities of mining companies which materially use mountain top removal in the United States. In addition, the company does not provide financing for new coal-fired power plants or new greenfield coal mining projects. Deutsche Bank’s sustainability department is responsible for assisting business units in assessing environmental and social issues and associated risks. In asset management, Deutsche Bank has set up an investment portal through which analysts have access to the latest results of ESG ratings and can include them in their decision-making. Companies which manufacture cluster munitions and landmines are excluded from its investment universe. In the field of customer and product responsibility, the results of client satisfaction surveys, mystery shopping as well as customer satisfaction indexes influence the assessment of success of Deutsche Bank's sales teams. Sales staff are trained on responsible sales practices and their performance is monitored on a regular basis. As announced in July 2019, Deutsche Bank is in the process of cutting about 18,000 jobs until 2022, mainly in the UK and the US. The company tries to avoid compulsory redundancies and provides outplacement services. Yet, it remains unclear whether all affected employees will be covered by these measures. A group-wide health and safety management system is in place and the company has implemented some measures to prevent mental health problems. Deutsche Bank has established group-wide codes and policies covering in varying levels of detail all important issues in the field of business ethics, such as corruption, antitrust violations, insider dealings and conflicts of interest. The company conducts compliance trainings as well as compliance risk assessments and audits. In addition, Deutsche Bank has implemented non-compliance reporting channels for whistleblowers. There is no indication on third party anti-corruption due diligence measures, though. In recent years, Deutsche Bank has been involved in numerous major controversies such as price fixing in the market for credit default swaps and non-compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. Further controversies include allegations of failures to control business practices in its foreign exchange trading operations. Deutsche Bank’s shareholder structure is dispersed and investors defined as having a long-term investment horizon hold the majority of shares (as at March 31, 2019). Regarding its governance structure, the independence of the company’s chairman, Mr. Paul Achleitner (as at January 31, 2019), is ensured and the majority of board members are independent. However, only a minority of the audit, the remuneration and the nomination committee are composed of independent directors. Moreover, the remuneration policy for executives is publicly disclosed and includes long-term incentive components, which could incentivize sustainable value creation. Deutsche Bank has set up a board committee tasked with the supervision of its sustainability strategy, which is composed of 50% independent members (as at January 31, 2019). Additionally, sustainability performance objectives are to some extent integrated into the variable remuneration of members of the executive management team.

ESG Corporate Rating / Last Modification: 2020-03-24 Page 2 of 44 © ISS ESG,Deutsche Bank AG Methodology - Overview The ESG Corporate Rating methodology was originally developed by Institutional Shareholder Services Germany (formerly oekom research) and has been consistently updated for more than 25 years. ESG Corporate Rating - The ESG Corporate Rating universe, which is currently expanding from more than 8,000 corporate issuers to a targeted 10,000 issuers in 2020, covers important national and international indices as well as additional companies from sectors with direct links to sustainability and the most important bond issuers that are not publicly listed companies. The assessment of a company's social & governance and environmental performance is based on approximately 100 environmental, social and governance indicators per sector, selected from a pool of 800+ proprietary indicators. All indicators are evaluated independently based on clearly defined performance expectations and the results are aggregated, taking into account each indicator’s and each topic’s materiality-oriented weight, to yield an overall score (rating). If no relevant or up-to-date company information with regard to a certain indicator is available, and no assumptions can be made based on predefined standards and expertise, e.g. known and already classified country standards, the indicator is assessed with a D-. In order to obtain a comprehensive and balanced picture of each company, our analysts assess relevant information reported or directly provided by the company as well as information from reputable independent sources. In addition, our analysts actively seek a dialogue with the assessed companies during the rating process and companies are regularly given the opportunity to comment on the results and provide additional information. Analyst Opinion - Qualitative summary and explanation of the central rating results in three dimensions: (1) Opportunities - assessment of the quality and the current and future share of sales of a company’s products and services, which positively or negatively contribute to the management of principal sustainability challenges. (2) Risks - summary assessment of how proactively and successfully the company addresses specific sustainability challenges found in its business activity and value chain, thus reducing its individual risks, in particular regarding its sector’s key issues. (3) Governance - overview of the company’s governance structures and measures as well as of the quality and efficacy of policies regarding its ethical business conduct. Controversial Business Practices - The assessment of companies' sustainability performance in the ESG Corporate Rating is informed by a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of companies' ability to prevent and mitigate ESG controversies. ISS ESG conducts research and analysis on corporate involvement in verified or alleged failures to respect recognized standards for responsible business conduct through Norm- Based Research . Norm-Based Research is based on authoritative standards for responsible business conduct such as the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights and the Sustainable Development Goals. As a stress-test of corporate disclosure, Norm-Based Research assesses the following: - Companies' ability to address grievances and remediate negative impacts - Degree of verification of allegations and claims - Severity of impact on people and the environment, and systematic or systemic nature of malpractices Severity of impact is categorized as Potential, Moderate, Severe, Very severe. This informs the ESG Corporate Rating. Decile Rank - The Decile Rank indicates in which decile (tenth part of total) the individual Corporate Rating ranks within its industry from 1 (best – company’s rating is in the first decile within its industry) to 10 (lowest – company’s rating is in the tenth decile within its industry). The Decile Rank is determined based on the underlying numerical score of the rating. If the total number of companies within an industry cannot be evenly divided by ten, the surplus company ratings are distributed from the top (1 decile) to the bottom. If there are Corporate Ratings with identical absolute scores that span a division in decile ranks, all ratings with an equal decile score are classified in the higher decile, resulting in a smaller number of Corporate Ratings in the decile below. Distribution of Ratings - Overview of the distribution of the ratings of all companies from the respective industry that are included in the ESG Corporate Rating universe (company portrayed in this report: dark blue).

Key Issue Performance - Overview of the company's performance with regard to the key social and environmental issues in the industry, compared to the industry average. Major Shareholders & Ownership Summary - Overview of the company's major shareholders at the time of generation of this report. All data as well as the categorisation system for the investor types is based on information from S&P Capital IQ . Rating History - Development of the company's rating over time and comparison to the average rating in the industry. Rating Scale - Companies are rated on a twelve-point scale from A+ to D-: A+: the company shows excellent performance. D-: the company shows poor performance (or fails to demonstrate any commitment to appropriately address the topic). Overview of the range of scores achieved in the industry (light blue) and indication of the grade of the company evaluated in this report (dark blue). Sources of Information - A selection of sources used for this report is illustrated in the annex. Status & Prime Threshold - Companies are categorized as Prime if they achieve/exceed the sustainability performance requirements (Prime threshold) defined by ISS ESG for a specific industry (absolute best-in-class approach) in the ESG Corporate Rating. Prime companies are sustainability leaders in their industry and are better positioned to cope with material ESG challenges and risks, as well as to seize opportunities, than their Not Prime peers. The financial materiality of the Prime Status has been confirmed by performance studies, showing a continuous outperformance of the Prime portfolio when compared to conventional indices over more than 14 years. Industry Classification - The social and environmental impacts of industries differ. Therefore, based on its relevance, each industry analyzed is classified in a Sustainability Matrix. Depending on this classification, the two dimensions of the ESG Corporate Rating, the Social Rating and the Environmental Rating, are weighted and the sector- specific minimum requirements for the ISS ESG Prime Status (Prime threshold) are defined (absolute best-in-class approach).

C O M / E S G 2 2 o f 2 3 ANNEX 2 : Methodology ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs The ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs serves as a structure for evaluating the sustainab ility quality – i.e. the social and environmental added value – of the use of proceeds of Deutsche Bank’s Green Bond . It comprises firstly the definition of the use of proceeds category offering added social and/or environmental value, and secondly the sp ecific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the assets can be clearly identified and described. The sustainability criteria are complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantit ative measurement of the sustainability performance of the assets and which can also be used for reporting. To review the KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Federico Pezzolato (details below ) who will send them directly to you. Asset evaluation methodol ogy ISS ESG evaluates whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eligible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bond KPIs . All percentages refer to the amount of assets within one category (e.g. wind power). Additionally, the asse ssment “no or limited information is available” either indicates that no information was made available to ISS ESG or that the information provided did not fulfil the requirements of the ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs. The evaluation was carried out using informa tion and documents provided to ISS ESG on a confidential basis by Deutsche Bank (e.g. Due Diligence Reports). Further, national legislation and standards, depending on the asset location, were drawn on to complement the information provided by the issuer. Assessment of the contribution and association to the SDG The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed in September 2015 by the United Nations and provide a benchmark for key opportunities and challenges toward a more sustainable future. Using a proprietary method, ISS ESG identifies the ex tent to which Deutsche Bank ’s Green Bond contributes to related SDGs and has a positive association with their respective sub - targets. The c ontribution assessment is split into two Levels: 1. Level 1: Contribut ion and/or obstruction of the Use of Proceeds cat egories to be financed through the bond to the UN SDGs 2. Level 2: Association of the assets’ ESG performance with further SDGs,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .
