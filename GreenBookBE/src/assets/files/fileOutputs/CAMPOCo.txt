Green Bond: GA1 August 25, 2020 ESG Dept., Credit Rating Planning and Research Office Analyst: Sayaka Saisho Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I) has confirmed the alignment of the financial instrument of CAMPO Co., Ltd. with the “Green Bond Principles 2018" and the Ministry of the Environment's “Green Bond Guidelines 2020," and has assigned an R&I Green Bond Assessment. ■ Overview of R&I Green Bond Assessment Financial Instrument The 4th Series Unsecured Bonds issued by CAMPO Co., Ltd. (Guaranteed by The Shiga Bank, Ltd., Limited to Qualified Institutional Investors) Use of proceeds Energy efficiency Pollution prevention and control Assessment GA1 Assessment by item Item Assessment Use of proceeds Process for project evaluation and selection Management of proceeds Reporting Environmental activities of the issuer * Each item is assessed on a 5-point scale, from (highest) to (lowest). Overall Assessment The proceeds will be used for the renewal of RPF production facilities of CAMPO Co., Ltd. (hereinafter CAMPO), with which waste plastics, etc. are recycled as raw materials. By replacing with more energy- efficient facilities, the company aims to increase the amount of RPF delivery and reduce CO2 emissions during the production process. Potential negative impacts during the plant is in operation are identified and addressed appropriately. R&I concludes that this project was selected in accordance with the company’s environmental philosophy “Co-exist with the Earth.” The proceeds will be managed appropriately, and the appropriation status will be reported. The expected reduction in CO2 emissions from the plant will be disclosed at the time of the issuance of the bond, and after the issuance, the results will be reported once every year. That is commendable. In light of the above, R&I considers that the green bond proceeds are used to invest in projects with environmental benefits to a significant degree, and therefore assigned GA1.,R&I Green Bond Assessment 2/10 ■ Overview of the Second Opinion (1) Use of Proceeds All amount of the proceeds raised through the green bonds will be used for the renewal of RPF (high- grade solid fuel derived from waste paper and waste plastics) production facilities, which is highly effective in reducing environmental load. In addition, the new facilities to be introduced are expected to have energy-saving effect (CO2 emission reduction effect). Therefore, the use of proceeds falls within the scope of “pollution prevention and control” and “energy efficiency.” Considerations are given to environmental impacts while the plant is in operation. The project provides a high degree of environmental benefits.

Outline of the Issuer CAMPO is a company headquartered in Kyoto, and engages in the co llection, transportation and intermediate processing of industrial waste. Since it s establishment in 1968, the company has worked on waste recycling, mainly in the Kansai region, toward the creation of a recycling-based society. In addition to the consulting business, collection, transportation, and intermediate processing of industrial waste, it has engaged in the production of refuse derived paper and plastics densified fuel (RPF), a solid fuel. The company has adopted a holding company system since 2007. The CAMPO Holdings Co., Ltd. is composed of CAMPO, TEX CAMPO Co., Ltd., and ASSIST CAMPO Co., Ltd., and each of them is making full use of their individuality in specialized fields including industrial waste processing, general waste processing and reclamation of valuable materials. The entire group is actively promoting environmental conservation. 2. Environmental Activities of the Issuer  CAMPO started the production of RPF, a solid fuel that reduces environmental load and realize the proper disposal of waste plastics, in 1995 and introduced it at the 3rd session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP3), which was held in Kyoto in 1997. In 2001, the company acquired ISO 14 001 certification, and established "Energy Campo 2," one of the largest RPF production plants in Japan, in 2005. The plant was certified as a JIS plant in 2011. They have been working to produce high-quality RPF.,R&I Green Bond Assessment 3/10 II. Second Opinion (Conformity Check) 1. Use of Proceeds (1) Eligible Projects  All of the proceeds will be used fo r the renewal of “Energy Campo 2” RPF production facilities that are certified as a JIS plant. The new facilities are scheduled to be put into service in September 2020.  RPF is a high-grade solid fuel mainly made from waste paper and waste plastics, which are industrial waste that are difficult to melt and recycle as formed articles. The most distinctive feature of RPF is that it uses industrial waste with an identified history of generation as a raw material, so contamination rarely occurs1. The required quality is defined in JIS established in 2010, and RPF products are classified into three grades, A, B and C, in ascending or der of increasing chlorine concentration2. Since it contains plastics, it has high calorific value with low price, so companies from various industries, including paper companies, steel companies, dyeing companies, use RPF.3 RPF is mainly used as a substitute for fossil fuels such as coal and coke, and is more effective in reducing environmental load than coal4. Furthermore, the low ashing rate (amount of ash recovered when the same amount of heat is generated by combustion) greatly reduces the amount of ash to be buried for the same amount of heat5. As Japan is still highly dependent on fossil fuels and has a small land area, it is an important fuel source that is environmentally friendly and contributes to resolving the issue of final disposal sites.  CAMPO has engaged in the production of RPF since 1995, before the establishment of the JIS standard. It began operating Japan's largest RPF production facility "Energy Campo 2" in 2005, and certified as a JIS plant in 2011. Since then, it has been producing RPF of grades A and B with lower environmental impacts. In order to renew the aging "Energy Campo 2", the company will establish a Green Bond Framework and allocate proceeds from the green bonds to the project. The introduction of high-efficiency facilities will reduce the amount of electricity requi red for RPF production, thereby saving energy and reducing CO2 emissions. In addition, by increasing the amount of RPF delivery, this project aims to promote the proper disposal of waste plastics and contribute to the “pollution prevention and control.”  The use of proceeds falls within the scope of "energy efficiency" and "pollution prevention and control" of the Green Bond Principles. The use of proceeds is specified in the Green Bond Framework, and will not be used for refinancing. The outline of how the proceeds will be used is provided in the Green Bond Framework developed by the company. (2) Environmental Benefits  Energy efficiency The introduction of the new high-efficiency facilities will reduce the amount of electricity required for RPF production, thereby is expected to save energy and reduce CO2 emissions. CAMPO expects an 1 It is different from refuse derived fuel (RDF) which is made from combustible refuse including kitchen refuse that is discharged from unspecified number of sources and collected by local governments. See the website of the Japan RPF Association (JRPF) (http://www.jrpf.gr.jp/en). 2The standard was established in 2010 by the Japanese Standards Association as "Refuse Derived Paper and Plastics Densified Fuel (RPF)." 3See the website of JRPF (http://www.jrpf.gr.jp/rpf-1-2). 4 RPF is said to be highly effective in reducing environmental load. For example, it results in about 33% less CO2 emissions than coal at the same calorific value recovery. See the JRPF website (http://www.jrpf.gr.jp/rpf-7-2), and the "Evaluation of Environmental Load Reduction Effect of Plastic Containers and Packaging Recycling Methods and Energy Recovery (LCA)" published by the Japan Initiative For Marine Environment (JaIME), which are available on the website of Japan Chemical Industry of Association (https://www.nikkakyo.org/content/evaluation-environmental-load-reduction- effect-plastic-containers-and-packaging-recycling). 5 The ashing rate of RPF is about 1/3 that of coal. See the website of JRPF (http://www.jrpf.gr.jp/rpf-7-2).,R&I Green Bond Assessment 4/10 environmental improvement effect of about 132 t-CO2 per year.  Pollution prevention and control With the increase in the amount of RPF delivery, the proper disposal of waste plastics will be promoted. (3) Consideration for Negative Environmental and Social Impacts  CAMPO has identified three potential environmental risks and has taken appropriate environmental protection measures in compliance with laws and regul ations. In addition, it carries out environmental impact assessments in line with environmental laws and local government ordinances. To prevent noise, the processing is performed in a building equipped with soundproof shutters, and to prevent vibration, the ground is solidified before constructing the plant. As a measure to prevent odor from leaking out of the plant, ozone deodorizers and dust collectors are installed. Potential Environmental Risks Major Environmental Conservation Measures Generation of noise The noise level is measured in accordance with the ordinance to make sure that the level is below the regulation standard. Generation of vibration The vibration level is measured in accordance with the ordinance to make sure that the level is below the regulation standard. Air pollution To prevent the scattering and outflow of waste and leakage of odors, vehicles that match the type and shape of waste are used. All amount of the proceeds raised through the green bonds will be used for the renewal of RPF (high-grade solid fuel derived from waste paper and waste plastics) production facilities, which is highly effective in reducing environmental load. In addition, the new facilities to be introduced are expected to have energy-saving effect (CO2 emission reduction effect). Therefore, the use of proceeds falls within the scope of “pollution prevention and control” and “energy efficiency.” Considerations are given to environmental impacts while the plant is in operation. R&I has determined that the project provides a high degree of environmental benefits. Source: Campo Group website,R&I Green Bond Assessment 5/10 2.

The authorities and resp onsibilities necessary for the ex ecution of each business are delegated to each operating company of the group so that each company can operate their business on their own responsibility, make decisions swiftly and strengthen their competitiveness in each business area.  When selecting technologies and facilities to be ne wly adopted, the primary evaluation is performed as follows: the President of the operating company, Facility Management Dept. and Processing Dept. of the company, and General Affairs Office and the Financial Accounting Office of the Administrative Dept. of CAMPO Holdings discuss and make comparisons with similar technologies from the environmental, economic, and financial perspectives to identify key fa ctors. Each time, the technologies and facilities selection criteria are reviewed. The final decision will be made by the board of directors of CAMPO Holdings.  Prior to the introduction of the highly efficient RPF production facilities, the above parties, led by the President of CAMPO, discussed and set two selection criteria: (1) to reduce the power consumption per unit required for production compared with the existing RPF production facilities, and (2) to increase the production capacity per unit of time. After the primary evaluation, the final decision was made by the board of directors of CAMPO Holdings. Technologies and facilities for which the proceeds will be used Criteria for selecting technologies and facilities Introduction of highly efficient RPF production facilities (1) To reduce the power consumption per unit required for production compared with the existing RPF production facilities. (2) To increase production capacity per unit of time. (3) Process for Project Evaluation and Selection  When selecting the green project for which the proceeds will be used, the Processing Dept. drafted the plan and carried out a comprehensive evaluation, while examining if the project conforms to the environmental policy of the CAMPO Gr oup, to what extent it will contri bute to the achievement of the environmental objectives and targets, and how probable it is that the project will produce environmental improvement effects. The finally decided project was approved by the President of CAMPO. The eligible project was selected in accordance with the CAMPO Group's environmental philosophy, which aims to be a company coexisting with the earth. The project evaluation and selection process is clear and reasonable.,R&I Green Bond Assessment 7/10 3. Management of Proceeds  Methods for tracking and managing the proceeds and managing unallocated proceeds are described in the Green Bond Framework and will be explained to investors in advance.  The bonds will be issued and redeemed by CAMPO, and the tracking management of the proceeds will be carried out by the Administrative Dept. of CAMPO Holdings. Subaccount items will be set individually for total amount of proceeds, proceeds allocated for the project and unallocated proceeds so that they are handled separately in accounting. Once all funding has been allocated, it will be made sure that the total amount of proceeds will not fall below the cumulative amount allocated to the project. These checks will be performed annually.  Unallocated proceeds are managed in cash, cash equivalents, or short-term financial assets.  Vouchers related to the funding will be appropriately managed in accordance with in-house rules of CAMPO. A framework is in place which is capable of tracking the flow of proceeds. Vouchers and other documents will be kept in accordance with in-house regulations, and unallocated funds will be managed in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term financial assets, and appropriate management method is established. 4. Reporting (1) Overview of Disclosure  Reporting methods CAMPO will disclose to the public on its website the latest information on the appropriation status of proceeds procured from the corporate bonds and the effects of environmental improvements, etc. The frequency is provided below. Even after all proceeds from the bonds have been allocated to the project, significant changes in circumstances will be disclosed as appropriate. (1) Report at the time of issuance: To be made soon after the issuance of the corporate bonds. (2) Annual reports: Once a year until the bonds will be redeemed.  Items to be disclosed The reporting will include the fo llowings. Environmental improvement effects will be appropriately calculated in accordance with the calculation method defined in the Framework. ・ List of projects for which the proceeds were used ・ Overview of projects (including the progress) ・ Amount of proceeds allocated to projects ・ Amount of unallocated proceeds, plans for the appropriation, and the method of managing unallocated proceeds ・ Environmental improvement effects produced through the green projects (Reduction in CO2 emissions)  Reporting System The Administrative Dept. of CAMPO Holdings is responsible for the creation of the report at the time of issuance and annual reports. The Administrative Dept. of CAMPO Holdings will also collect information,R&I Green Bond Assessment 8/10 on the proceeds and confirm the items to be reported. Information on the environmental improvement effects will be collected by the Facility Management Dept. and Processing Dept. of CAMPO, and the Administrative Dept. of CAMPO Holdings will confirm the items to be reported. For the calculation of environmental improvement effects, they are planning to seek advice from an independent third-party organization. (2) Indicators to Show Environmental Benefits and Calculation Method, etc.  Reduction in CO2 emissions and the amount of RPF delivery will be disclosed in the reporting. Reduction effects in CO2 emissions are calculated as follows. CO2 emissions reduced as a result of the introduction of highly efficient facilities Calculation method Calculated by comparing energy consumption by the facilities introduced through the project with that by the facilities before the project is put into practice (facilities before the renewal). Calculation formula [Reduction in CO2 emissions (t-CO2 /year)] = [CO2 emissions from facilities before renewal (t- CO2/year)] - [CO2 emissions from the new facilities (t-CO2/year)] [CO2 emissions from facilities before renewal (t-CO2/year)] = (CO2 emissions per unit from facilities before renewal (t-CO2/t) × Annual RPF production after renewal (t)) * CO2 emissions per unit from facilities before renewal (t-CO2/t) = (Annual power consumption before renewal (kWh) × Power emission factor (kg-CO2/kWh) ÷ 1,000) ÷ Annual RPF production before renewal (t) [CO2 emissions from the new facilities (t-CO2/year)] = Annual power consumption after renewal (kWh) × Power emission factor (kg-CO2/kWh) ÷ 1,000 CO2 reduction effect which is expected as a result of the renewal of facilities will be disclosed at the time of the issuance of the bond. After the issuance, the proceeds appropriation status, reduction in CO2 emissions, and the amount of RPF delivery will be disclosed once a year. Reporting is appropriate.,R&I Green Bond Assessment 9/10 III.

Detailed review Reviewers are encouraged to provide the information below to the extent possible and use the comment section to explain the scope of their review. 1. USE OF PROCEEDS Overall comment on section (if applicable) : ＜ Evaluation on the Green Bond Framework ＞ R&I has determined that the use of proceeds is appropriate based on the confirmation that (1) sufficient environmental benefits are expected from the project, and (2) consideration is given to potential negative impact on the environment/society. All amount of the proceeds raised through the green bonds will be used for the renewal of RPF (high ‐ grade solid fuel derived from waste paper and waste plastics) production facilities, which is highly effective in reducing environmental load. In addition, the new facilities to be introduced are expected to have energy ‐ saving effect (CO2 emission reduction effect).

Second Party Opinion : An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. 2. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. 3. Certification : An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. 4. Green Bond Scoring/Rating : An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 ‐ degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.
