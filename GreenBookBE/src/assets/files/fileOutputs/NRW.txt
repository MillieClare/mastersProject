page 1 NRW. BANK , the state development bank of North - Rhine Westph alia (NRW), has commissioned oekom research 1 to a ssist with the issuance of its Green Bond by assessing the sustainable added value of this bond. oekom research’s mandate included the following services: • Definition of Green Bond KPIs (“oekom Green Bond KPIs ”) containing a clear description of eligible asset categories and the social and environmental criteria assigned to each category for evaluating the sustainability - related performance of the assets (re - ) financed through the proceeds of the bond. • Analysis of the alignment of the Green Bond against the ICMA’s Green Bond Principles. • Evaluation of compliance of the Green Bond with the oekom KPIs. • Review and classification of NRW.BANK’s sustainability performance on the basis of the oekom Corporate Rating. • Analysis of the alignment of the Green Bond against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) oekom’s overall evaluation of the Green Bond by NRW.BANK is positive: • NRW.BANK has defined a formal concept for its Green Bonds regarding use of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the Green Bond Principles (Part I of this Second Party Opinion). • The overall sustainability quality of the financed projects in terms of sustainability benefits and risk avoidance and minimisation is good (Part II of this Second Party Opinion ). • The issuer itself shows a good sustainability performance (Part III of this Second Party Opinion). The Green Bond shows a good sustainability performance and positively contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals. However, t here are some aspects fo r which a better sharing of information could lead to a better assessment of the sustainable quality of the projects ; this is especia lly the case for 1 On March 15, 2018, oekom research joined Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS”). oekom research will be renamed ISS - oekom. Assessment of the Sustainability Quality of the Green Bond 201 8 issued by NRW.BANK 5 June 18 Aim and Scope of this Second Party Opinion Overall Evaluation of the Green Bond,page 2 information related to solar projects , or information on life cycle assessments in categories such as public transportation.,page 3 1) U se of Proceeds The proceeds of this Green Bond will be used exclusively to refinance loans which have already been granted and whose intended purposes are clearly defined and limited by the project categories and criteria specified below. The following categories h ave been chosen for allocatin g the proceeds of this issuance: Project Area Financed P rojects Percentage of Bond I ssuance Renewable energy A Wind power € 326,248,533 65 onshore projects 65 % B Solar energy € 2,966,970 6 PV projects <1% Clean transportation C Electric vehicles ( electric cars) € 95,700 1 electric vehicle <1 % D Public transportation ( electric buses) € 2,646,200 8 electric buses <1% E Public transportation ( electric trams) € 4,000,000 12 trams 1% F Transport infrastructure (c harging stations) € 500,000 C harging stations <1 % G T ransport infrastructure ( electric signal l ing box) € 2,225,000 1 signaling box <1% Green buildings H Modernisation of educational and public health facilities € 114,347,537 4 university hospitals 23 % Part I – Green Bond Principles,page 4 J L oans for energy efficient residential buildings € 46,970,060 Several energy efficiency renovations of residential buildings 9% Total € 500, 000,000 100% All projects meet specific environmental and social standards (see part II of this document). These criteria are clearly defined and assessable using quantitative indicators. The criteria are designed to ensure a positive impact of the projects which is not impaired by adverse impacts and effects in other areas (e.g. environmental impacts , impacts on local communities) 2) Process for Project Evalua tion and Selection The selection of assets for inclusion in the Green Bond is carried out internally by NRW. BANK . The department Capital Market, more precisely NRW.BANK’s Green Bond Team carries out this selection . The selection is based on a set of eligibility criteria defined by NRW. BANK , which are : • C ontribution to the sustainability strategy of the German State of North Rhine - Westphalia as well as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. • Contribution to the fight against climate change • Mitigation: limiting greenhouse gas emissions in contribution to the goal of limiting temperature rises to two degrees Celsius above pre - industrial levels , as stated by the UNFCC Paris Agreement. 3) Management of Proceeds The proceeds of this Green Bond will be exclusively used to r efinance loans disbursed no t longer than 12 months before the start of the Second Party Opinion and which correspond to the eligibility criteria above . The chosen projects are thus internally earmarked and will be exclusively refin anced via this Green Bond. The proceeds are immediately allocated to the refinancing of the loans, which spares the issuer a specific ring - fencing. According to the issuer, the term of the bond corresponds to the shortest single repayment term. Thus, no re investment of funds – topping up – will take place during the duration of the bond, rendering an assessment of additional loans and projects unnecessary. 4) Reporting NRW.BANK commits to a regular reporting towards the Green Bond’s investors via its dedicated web page ( http://www.nrwbank.com/greenbond ) and in its yearly Susta inability Report . The reporting includes an impact assessment in line with the recommendations of the Harmonized Framework for Impact Reporting 2 . The impact assessment on the indicators relating to this Green Bond is executed and verified by the Wuppertal Institut e . 2 http://treasury.worldbank.org/cmd/pdf/InformationonImpactReporting.pdf,page 5 1) oekom Green Bond KPIs The oekom Green Bond KPIs serve as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality – i.e. the social and environmental added value – of the use of proc eeds of NRW.BANK ’s Green Bond . It comprises firstly the definition of the use of proceeds category offering added social and/or environmental value and secondly the specific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the susta inabilit y performance of the Green Bond can be clearly identified and described . The sustainability criteria are complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measurement of the sustainabilit y performance of the Green Bond and which can a lso be used for reporting. Details on the individual criteria and indicators for the categories can be found in Annex 1 „oekom Green Bond KPIs “. 2) Evaluation of the P rojects Refinanced by the Green Bond Methods oekom research has evaluated whether the assets included in the Green Bond Asset Pool match the categories and criteria listed in the oekom Green Bond KPIs . The evaluation was carried out using information and documents provided to oekom research on a confident ial basis by NRW.BANK (e.g. information on credit guidelines). Further , national legislation and standards, depending on the asset location, were drawn on to complement the information provided by NRW BANK . All percentages refer to the respective volume of the loans within the Green Bonds. Part II – Sustainability Quality of the Green Bond,page 6 Findings A. Wind power Share in use of proceeds: € 326 , 248,533 ( 65 % of the total credit amount) Project types: Construction and operation of wind power plants Loan recipients: Public and private wind park operators and cooperatives 1. Site selection ü None of the projects are located in key biodiversity areas (Ramsar sites, IUCN protected areas I - IV). ü 53 projects, accounting for 90,31% of the loans’ volume, underwent environmental impact assessments at the planning stage. 2. Community dialogue ü 53 projects, accounting for 90,31% of the of loans’ volume, feature community dialogue as an integral part of t he planning process (e.g. sound information of communities, community advisory panels and committees, surveys and dialogue platforms, grievance mechanisms and compensation schemes). Sustainability Risks and Benefits of the Project Category This project category contributes to the following SDGs: • SDG 13 (climate action) • SDG 7 (affordable clean energy) The environmental benefits of wind power generation projects comprise the contribution to climate protection and to the transition towards a low - carbon economy. Further benefits are less environmental degradation and pollution (e.g. through resource extraction, releases of waste streams to water or soil) in comparison to fossil fuel or nuclear power plants. From a social perspective, the transition from fossil fuels to wind power lowers negative human rights impacts of oil, gas and coal production (e.g. land - use conflicts, resettlement). In addition – different from fossil fuels combustion - wind power does not negatively impact air q uality. However, the construction and operation of wind power plants can result in negative environmental impacts (e.g. noise and other negative impacts on biodiversity) and impacts on local communities. Further risks include potentially poor working cond itions during construction and maintenance of power plants (especially with respect to worker safety) as well as in the production processes of wind power equipment. As the construction of these plants requires large amounts of raw materials and equipment, life cycle aspects are an important factor when assessing the overall environmental footprint of related projects. All wind power projects selected for the Green Bond are located in Germany, a country with high level of social and environmental legislati on .,page 7 3. Environmental aspects of construction and operation ü 53 projects, accounting for 90,31% of the of loans’ volume, meet h igh environmental standards during the construction phase (e.g. noise mitigation, minimisation of environmental impact during construction work). ü 53 projects, accounting for 90,31% of the of loans’ volum e, provide for measures to protect habitat and wildlife during operation of the power plant (e.g. measures to protect birds and bats ). 4. Working conditions during construction and maintenance work ü 100% of the projects are located in a country that provid e s for high labour and health and safety standards for construction and maintenance work (e.g. ILO core conventions). Controversy assessment For 64 projects, accounting for 99 ,82 % of the loans’ volume, a controversy assessment did not reveal any controversial activities or practices that could be attributed to NRW.BANK. For 1 project, accounting for 0,18 % of the loans’ volume, the controversy assessment revealed a potential controversy: the association of environmental agencies in North - Rhine Westphalia ( Landesbüro der Naturschutzverbände NRW ) , in an official statement directed at the city of Paderborn, criticised the construction of one project for a n allegedly faulty expert assessment on species protecti on within the application process to construct the wind power plant. To the knowledge of oekom research the case had not been resolved until the issue date .,page 8 B. Solar power Share in use of proceeds: € 2 , 966,970 ( 0,59 % of the total credit amount) Project types: Construction and operation of PV plants and rooftop installations Loan recipients: Public and private solar park operators and cooperatives 1. Site Selection (not applicable for PV roof systems): ü 2 project s , accounting for 100% of the applicable loans’ volume, are not located in key biodiversity areas (Ramsar sites, IUCN protected areas I - IV). 2. Supply chain standards ¢ No information is available on high labour and health and safety standards in the supply chain of solar modules (e.g. ILO core conventions). 3. Environmental aspects of solar power plants ¢ No information is available on projects that feature a conversion efficiency of at least 15%. ¢ No information is available on projects that provide for high environmental standards regarding take - back and recycling of solar modules at end - of - life stage (e.g. in line with WEEE requirements) . Sustainability Risks and Benefits of the Asset Category This project category contributes to the following SDGs: • SDG 13 (climate action) • SDG 7 (affordable clean energy) The environmental benefits of PV power generation projects comprise the contribution to climate protection and to the transition towards a low - carbon economy. Further benefits are less environmental degradation and pollution (e.g. resource extraction, re leases of waste streams to water or soil) in comparison to fossil fuel or nuclear power plants. From a social perspective, the transition from fossil fuels to PV power reduces negative human rights impacts of oil, gas and coal production (e.g. land - use con flicts, resettlement). In addition – different from fossil fuels combustion - PV power does not negatively impact air quality. With respect to potential risks, the manufacturing of PV panels in developing countries such as China can have negative social a nd environmental impacts. As the production of PV panels requires scarce raw materials and as the panels contain hazardous substances, aspects such as recyclability, management of hazardous substances and conversion efficiency are relevant to evaluate the overall environmental performance of related projects. However, in comparison with other renewable energy sources, social and environmental risks related to PV power are deemed to be low. All PV assets selected for the Green Bond are located in highly - reg ulated and developed countries.,page 9 ¢ No information is available on projects that provide for high standards regarding the reduction or elimination of toxic substances within solar panels (e.g. in line with RoHS requirements or other relevant standards). 4. Working conditions during construction and maintenance work ü All the projects provide for high labour and health and safety standards for construction and maintenance work (e.g. ILO core conventions). Controversy Assessment (not applicable for PV roof systems) A controversy assessment on the included project s did not reveal any controversial activities or practices that could be attributed to NRW.BANK.,page 10 C.

(e.g. ILO core conventions). 2. Environmental aspects of cars ¢ For the only financed project, no information on a compr ehensive life - cycle - assessment is available. ü The only financed project is an electric vehicle therefore energy efficiency during operation is assured. 3. Social aspects of cars ü For the only financed project, product safety is ensured (minimum of 3 Stars r ating on NCAP crash test). Controversy Assessment Due to the nature of the project , oekom research did not retain necessary conducting a controversy assessment. Sustainability Risks and Benefits of the Asset Category This project category contributes to the following SDGs: • SDG 13 (climate action) • SDG 11 ( sustainable cities and communities) The use of electric cars is positive from an environmental point of view as electric cars help to foster climate protection through lower carbon emissions compared to combustion engines. Additionally, noise levels in cities can be reduced through electric vehicles. At the same time, when evaluating the production of electric cars , certain ris ks have to be taken into account. Major risks from an environmental point of view stem from the negligence of environmental impacts throughout the whole life - cycle (i.e. all impacts from cradle to grave). From a social point of view, electric vehicle trans port risks are associated to injuries and fatalities caused by car accidents.,page 11 D. Public transportation ( electric buses) Share in use of proceeds: € 2,646,200 ( 0,53 % of the total credit amount) Project types: Construction and operation of 8 electric buses Loan recipients: Public operator 1.

From a social point of view, passenger bus transport helps to reduce inequalities as it gives mobility to people not possessing a private vehicle. At the same time, when evaluating the production of electric buses , certain risks have to be taken into account. Major risks from an environmental point of view stem from the ne gligence of environmental impacts throughout the whole life - cycle (i.e. all impacts from cradle to grave). Social risks stem from safety of both workers at production sites and potential bus operators and passengers .,page 12 E. Public transportation ( electric trams ) Share in use of proceeds: € 4,000,000 ( 0,80 % of the total credit amount) Project types: Construction and operation of 12 trams Loan recipients: Public operator 1.

Sustainability Risks and Benefits of the Project Category This project category contributes to the following SDGs: • SDG 13 (climate action) • SDG 11 ( sustainable cities and communities) The production of electric trains is positive from an environmental point of view as electric trains help to foster climate protection through lower carbon emissions. From a social point of view, passenger train transport helps to reduce injuries and fatal ities caused by car accidents. At the same time, when evaluating the production of electric trains, certain risks have to be taken into account. Major risks from an environmental point of view stem from the negligence of environmental impacts throughout the whole life - cycle (i.e. all impacts from cradle to grave). Social risks stem from safety of both workers at production sites and potential train operators and passengers. All projects selected for the Green Bond are in highly - regulated and developed co untries.,page 13 F. Transport infrastructure ( charging station ) Share in use of proceeds: € 500,000 ( 0,10 % of the total credit amount) Project types: Construction of electric vehicle charging stations inside carparks Loan recipients: Public operator 1. Environmental aspects of charging stations ¢ None of the projects have available information on comprehensive life - cycle - assessments. 2. Working conditions during construction and maintenance work ü All projects provide for high labour and health and safety standards for construction and maintenance work (e.g. ILO core conventions). Controversy Assessment Due to the nature of the project , no controversy assessment was conducted . Sustainability Risks and Benefits of the Asset Category This project category contributes to the following SDGs: • SDG 13 (climate action) • SDG 11 ( sustainable cities and communities) The production of charging stations for electric cars is positive from an environmental point of view as they provide the underlying infrastructure that help s foster ing climate protection through lower carbon emissions. At the same time, when evaluating the production of charging stations , certain risks have to be taken into account.

From a social point of view, signalling boxes increase the safety of infra structure operation. At the same time, when evaluating public transport projects, certain risks have to be taken into account. Major risks from an environmental point of view stem from the potential negligence of environmental impacts during construction of signalling boxes . Social risks of signalling boxes concern the health and safety of workers at construction sites and transport safety.,page 15 H. Modernisation of educational and public health facilities Share in use of proceeds: € 1 1 4,347,537 (23 % of the total credit amount)  Project types: Modernisation and extension of university medical clinics Loan recipients: University clinics Aix - la - Chapelle , Bonn, Mu nster and Cologne 1. Achieved energy efficiency (modernisations only) ¢ No information is available on achieved energy efficiency of financed projects. ü For 100% of financed projects, the German Energy - Saving Ordinance (Energieeinsparverordnung/EnEV) requires compliance wit h detailed and stringent energy performance standards. 2. Safe disposal of removed construction materials that are harmful to health (modernisations only) ü For 100% of financed projects, the implementing construction companies and subcontractors isolate and remove waste and pollutants in compliance with local r egulation. Sustainability Risks and Benefits of the Project Category This project category contributes to the following SDGs: • SDG 13 (climate action) • SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) • SDG 3 (good health and well - being) Sustainability benefits encompass enhanced provision of public health services and the establishment of additional university training facilities. Furthermore, energy efficiency improvements in existing buildings help reduce energy consumption in the long - run and therefore reinforce the transition towards a low carbon economy. When modernising facilities minimum energy efficiency improvements should be achieved to reduce the impact of those facilities on the environment. Additionally, improper disposal of hazardous substances can lead to negative environmental impacts. Social and environmental risks that can arise from all projects are: construction workers’ health and safety as well as overall working conditions and environmental hazards caused during con struction. Regarding new builds, social and environmental impacts in the supply chain need to be considered and affected communities involved in the planning process to ensure all stakeholders are heard. All modernisation and extension projects selected f or the Green Bond are located in Germany, a country with high level of social and environmental legislation .,page 16 3. Working conditions during construction work ü For 100% of projects high labour standards regarding e.g. working time, periods of rest, minimum wages, freedom of association, collective bargaining and non - discrimination (in accordance with local regulations) are in place. ¢ In one project, a fatal accident leading to the death of one worker occurred during the maintenance phase. Liability cannot be attributed to NRW.BANK . 4. Consideration of environmental aspects during planning and construction (new builds only) ü For 100% of financed projects, the Collective Bargaining and Public Procurement Act of North Rhine - Westphalia (Tariftreue - und Vergabegesetz NRW/TVgG - NRW) bindingly requires consideration of energy efficiency and other environmental aspects. ¢ No information is available on the number of projects for which comprehensive and specific environmental standards (regarding e.g. noise mitigation, minimisation of envi ronmental impact during construction work) are applied. 5. Social and environmental standards in the supply chain (new builds only) ü For 100% of financed projects, the Collective Bargaining and Public Procurement Act of North Rhine - Westphalia (Tariftreue - und Vergabegesetz NRW/TVgG - NRW) applies. It requires compliance with the ILO core conventions in the supply chain. ü For 100% of financed projects, the Collective Bargaining and Public Procurement Act of North Rhine - Westphalia (Tariftreue - und Vergabegesetz NRW/TVgG - NRW) requires that sustainability criteria such as energy and resource efficiency have to be taken into consideration in all public procurement contracts. ¢ No information is available on the number of projects for which comprehensive and specific environmental supply chain standards are applied. 6. Community dialogue (new builds only) ü 100% of financed projects comply with the regulations of the German Building Code (Baugesetzbuch/BauGB). The regulations provide for the consideration of local resi dents’ interests during the development of land - use plans and zoning maps (e.g. through public display of development plans, possibility to voice concerns, case - dependent compensation measures). Controversy assessment A controversy assessment on the included projects did not reveal any controversial activities or practices that could be attributed to NRW.BANK apart from the above - mentioned fatal accident.,page 17 I. L oans for energy efficient residential buildings Share in use of proceeds: € 46,970,060 ( 9 % of the total credit amount) Project types: E nergy efficiency renovations of residential buildings Loan reci pient: P rivate borrower 1. Achieved energy efficiency of buildings ¢ No information is available on the annual primary energy consumption for space heating and domestic water of financed buildings. ü For 100% of loans allocated to residential buildings , the credit terms require that building regulations of the Energy Saving Ordinance (E nergiee insparverordnung / EnEV) must always be observed in the versi on applicable at the time of credit application. 2. Responsible treatment of customers with debt repayment problems ¢ NRW.BANK has preventive measures and sustainable solutions for customers with debt repayment problems in place (e.g. pro - actively approaching customers potentially at risk, internal debt counselling and support for external debt counselling and foreclosure as a last resort). However, due to NRW.BANK’s business model as a development bank these loans are granted by the client’s principle bank and not NRW.BANK directly. Therefore NRW.BANK’s measures do n o t apply and no statement on the share of loans ensuring preventive measures and sustainable solutions for customers with debt repayment problems can be made . Controversy Assessment Due to the nature of the project , no controversy assessment was conducted . Sustainability Risks and Benefits of the Project Category This project category contributes to the following SDGs: • SDG 13 (climate action) • SDG 11 ( sustainable cities and communities) Private loans for energy efficient buildings are beneficial from an environmental point of view as they contribute to climate protection through optimised energy use. Due to the small scale of work and resources involved in building private homes as well as due to the fact that the buildings are in Germany, environmental and social impacts from the construction of private homes are comparably low. However, p rojects in this category bear similar social and environmental risks as those in category B. Furthermore, fair b anking practices need to be in place in the retail client business in order to mitigate potential social risks, e.g. over - indebtedness or foreclosure.,page 18 Climate Bond Initiative Standard All of the wind and solar power projects as well as the public transport projects that received loans to be refinanced by NRW.BANK’s Green Bond 2018 meet the eligibility criteria of the Climate Bonds Standard for Wind Energy 3 , Solar Energy 4 and Low Carbon Transport 5 respectively: Eligible project s and assets relating to wind energy generation are projects and assets that operate or are under construction to operate in one or more of the following activities: • Onshore wind energy generation facilities • Dedic ated operational production, manufacturing or distribution facilities for key components, such as wind turbines, platforms etc. • Dedicated transmission infrastructure and support facilities Eligible project s and assets relating to solar energy generation are projects and assets that operate or are under construction to operate in one or more of the following activities: • Onshore solar electricity generation facilities • Wholly dedicated transmission infrastructu re and other supporting infrastructure for onshore solar electricity generation facilities including inverters, transformers, energy storage systems and control systems • Onshore solar thermal facilities such as solar hot water systems E ligible project s and a sset category relating to low carbon transport are projects and assets that operate or are under construction to operate in one or more of the following activities: All infrastructure, infrastructure upgrades, rolling stock and vehicles for electrified public transport, including electrified rail, tra ms, trolleybuses and cable cars as well as b uses with no d irect emissions (electric and hydrogen). 3 https://www.climatebonds.net/files/files/Sector%20Criteria%20 - %20Wind%20v1_0%281%29.pdf 4 https://www.climatebonds.net/files/files/Sector%20Criteria%20 - %20Solar%20v2_1.pdf 5 https://www.climatebonds.net/files/files/Low%20Carbon%20Transport%20Background%20Paper%20Feb%202017.pdf,page 19 In the oekom C o r porate Rating with a rating scale from A+ (excellent) to D - (poor), NRW.
