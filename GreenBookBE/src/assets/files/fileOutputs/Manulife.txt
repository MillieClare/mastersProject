INTRODUCTION Manulife has developed a G reen Bond Framework in accordance with which it intends to issue g reen b onds to fund environmentally beneficial projects related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and environmental and ecosystems improve ments . This Green Bond Framework has been published in a separate docu ment on the Manulife’s Investor Relations webpage . An amount equal to the net proceeds of each G re en B ond will be used to finance or re finance, in whole or in part, existing and future p rojects that meet the Eligibility Criteria in one or more of the seven Categories defined in the Framework. 1. Renewable Energy 2. Green Buildings 1 3. Environmentally Sustainable Management of Natural Resources and Land Use 2 4. Energy Efficiency 5. Clean Transportation 6. Sustainable Water Management 7. Pollution Prevention and Control For Manulife’s potential inaugural g reen b ond issuance, the E ligible Assets are expected to fall under the Renewable Energy category . T he potential issuance has been Climate Bond certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative, an investor - focused not - for - profit organization, promoting large - scale investment in the low - carbon economy. For further detail s , see the CBI Verification Letter . Manulife engaged Sustainalytics to review the Green Bond F ramework and provide a second - party opinion on the alignment of the Framework with the Green Bond Principles 20 17 (the “GBP”), as administered by the International Capital Market Association (the “ICMA”) . 3 As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Manulife ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of thei r business processes and planned use of proceeds , as well as the management of proceeds and reporting aspects of Manulife’s G reen B ond F ramework . Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information . This document contains Su stainalytics’ opinion of the Manulife Green Bond Framework and should be read in conjunction with that F ramework. 1 See Appendix 2 : Comparison of Real Estate Certification Schemes 2 See Appendix 3: Sustainalytics Analysis of Forestry Certification Schemes 3 ICMA’s Green Bond Principles 2017 https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/documents/Regulatory/Green - Bonds/GreenBondsBrochure - JUNE2017.pdf,© Sustainalytics 2017 4 2. SUSTAINALYTICS’ OPIN ION Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Manulife Green Bond Framework Summary Overall, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Manulife Green Bond Framework is transparent, creates meaningful environmental impacts, and aligns with the Green Bond Principles 2017. Some specific elements of the Framework that Sustainalytics’ views favourably include: • All eligibilit y criteria for the Use of Proceeds are recognized by the Green Bond Principles 2017 as project categories with clear environmental impacts . Where relevant, some of the eligibility criteria make reference to credible third - party standards, such as LEED, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). • Manulife will establish a Green Bond Register to record the ongoing allocation of net proceeds from the bond . A ll Green Bond funds will be earmarked with in the R egister for allocation to the E ligible A ssets. Manulife’s disclosure and processes with respect to management of proceeds in line with market practices . • Regarding the process for project selection, Manulife has a dedicated Sustainability Accounting team and a Green Bond Council, composed of executive management. The Council includes the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Investment Officer , and Group Treasurer . All potential assets are reviewed by the Sustainability Accounting team to ensure they me et the criteria for E ligible A ss ets and then approved by the Green Bond Council . This is in line with recommended market best practice. • On an annual basis and until ful l allocation of proceeds, Manulife will publish a “ Green Bond Report ” disclosing the all ocation of proc eeds per criteria category together with examples of projects being financed. Where feasible , the report will include qualitative and possibly quantitative environmental performance indicators. This information will be externally re viewed, w hich is in line with market practice s . • Sustainalytics encourages Manulife where possible to report on further quantitative KPIs relevant to project criteria categories. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 2017: Sustainalytics has determined that the Man ulife Green Bond Framework aligns to the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 201 7 . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 4 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form .,© Sustainalytics 2017 5 Sect ion 2 : Sustainability Performance of the Issuer Con tribution of F ramework to Manulife’s sustainability strategy In the company’s 2016 Public Accountability Statement, Manulife’s recognizes that the effects of climate change and dwindling natural resources may have an impact on the long - term well - bein g of its business. Furthermore, Manulife states that , as a large, long - term investor, the company is in a unique position to help facilitate the transition to a more sustainable economy. 4 Manulife has identified key areas where the company can have the g reatest positive environmental impact . These areas include the company’s investment and lending activities, own operations, and its real estate portfolio. More specifically, the company’s environme ntal initiatives are focused within three key areas : Re spo nsible Financing and Investing: Manulife is a founding Canadian member of the Accounting for Sustainability CFO Leadership Network, and the signatory to the Equator Principles. Manulife Asset Management is a signatory to the Principles of Responsible Inves tment . It has dedicated in - house renewable energy investment expertise . T he company’s investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects during 2016 totaled CAN$ 1.5 billion 5 and , as of year - end 2016, its cumulative investments totaled CAN$ 1 0.9 billion. Sustainable Real Estate: The company introduced a new Sustainable Real Estate Policy in 2016 and established a Real Estate Executive Sustainability Steering Committee to guide sustainab ility efforts. Manulife reported that , as of year - end 201 6, 28.7 million of its real estate office space ( 4 2 % of its overall real estate portfolio ) received a sustainable building certification such as LEED, Energy Star, or BOMA Best . 6 The company reports that it continues to strive for an annual 2 per cent ener gy use reduction target across its real estate portfolio . 7 Managing Operational Footprint: Manulife uses a proprietary utility consumption reporting system to collect information on energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, water, waste, paper, and business t ravel. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Manulife’s sustainability efforts and demonstrated positive environmental performance are in l ine with the objectives of the Green B ond F ramework to contribute to the transition to a low - carbon economy. 4 Manulife Public Accountability Statement 2 016 http://www.manulife.com/Public - Accountability - Statement?ocmsLang=en_US 5 Manulife Public Accountability Statement 2016 http://www.manulife.com/Public - Accountability - Statement?ocmsLang=en_US 6 Manulife Real Estate Sustainability Report 2017 https://manuliferealestate.com/sites/default/files/downloads/manulife - real - estate - and - john - hancock - real - estate - 2017 - sustainability - report.pdf 7 Manulife Public Accountability Statement 2016 http://www.manulife.com/Public - Accountability - Statement?ocmsLang=en_US,© Sustainalytics 2017 6 Wel l positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects T he company is well positioned to manage key environmental and social risks associated with the Green Bond projects. S ome key environmental and social risks associa ted with the Eligible A ssets are worker safety, biodiversity loss , and pollution control in the construction and development of projects. Manulife’s Green Bond Framework outlines that the company assesses ESG issues in the course of evaluating and monitor ing all investments, including investments in E ligible A ssets for each Green Bond. This decision - making process is governed by the company’s i nvestment g uidelines, which incorporate the management of ESG risks. Furthermore, a Green Bond Council, comprised of executive management, oversees the selection process of potential investments for the proceeds of the Green Bond. T his is in line with recommended market best practice. Moreover, a s a signatory to the Equator Principles , the company identifies and mana ges environmental and social risks in all project finance transactions. In 2016, Manulife reported that no projects were identified as having potential significant adverse social or environmental impacts that are diverse, irreversible, or unprecedented. 8 Giv en the activities described above , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Manulife’s general process to consider environmental and social factors in its financing process is in line with market norms . Section 3 : Impact of Use of Proceeds The proceeds of the bond will be used for projects in the following seven categories : 1. Renewable Energy 2. Green Buildings 3. Environmentally Sustainable Management of Natural Resources and Land Use 4. Energy Efficiency 5. Clean Transportation 6. Sustainable Water Management 7. Polluti on Prevention and Control A ll of the above - mentioned green categories defined in Manulife’s Green Bond Framework are recognized as having beneficial environmental impacts by the Green Bond Principles, 2017. Alignment with/contribution to S ustainable D ev elopment G oal s (SDG) The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 by the United Nations and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. Th e Manulife Green B ond Framework advances the following SDG goals and targets: 8 Manulife Public Accountability Statement 2016 http://www.manulife.com/Public - Accountability - Statement?ocmsLang=en_US,© Sustainalytics 2017 7 U se o f P roceeds Category SDG SDG target Renewable Energy 7.

In alignment with Manulife’s sustainability focus , proceeds of the bonds may be directed towards the following eligible categories: 1) renewable energy, 2) green buildings, 3) environmentally sustainable management of natural resources and land u se , 4) energy efficiency, 5) clean transportation, 6) sustainable water management, and 7) pollution prevention and control. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that E ligible Assets will have clear benefits for clima te change mitigation and adaptation , will contribute to achieving Manulife’s sustaina bil it y goals and long - term vision, and will help advance six of the SDGs. All potential green investments are vetted by the Sustainability Accounting team to ensure that they meet the criteria for E ligible A ssets. Manulife’s E ligible Assets are approved by a dedicated Green Bond Council, composed of senior management. This is in line with recommended market best practice. The company will publish an annual “ Green Bond Rep ort ” that will provide the amounts allocated by criteria category , together with examples of projects that are being financed . Additionally, the company aspires to impact reporting , where feasible, on qualitative and quantitative environmental performance indicators . This information will be externally verified, which is in line with market practice s . Based on the a bove, Sustainal y t ics is confident that Manulife is well position ed to issue a Green Bond, and that the Manulife Green Bond Framework is robust , transparent , and in alignment with the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2017.,© Sustainalytics 2017 9 APPENDICES Appendix 1: Manulife Green Bond Use of Proceeds Eligibility Criteria Category Eligible Projects Renewable Energy Development, construction, operati on, maintenance and upgrades of: i. facilities and equipment wholly dedicated to the generation of renewable energy as defined by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Statute 9 including : ▪ wind energy ▪ solar energy ▪ small - scale (under 25 Mega Wat ts) and run - of - river hydro ▪ bio - energy from waste biomass ▪ tidal energy ▪ geothermal energy ii. transmission infrastructure and other supporting infrastructure wholly dedicated to renewable energy generation facilities including inverters, transformers, energy storage systems and control system iii. production or manufacturing facilities wholly dedicated to equipment, feedstock or components for renewable energy generation facilities Green buildings Purchase, construction, operation and maintenance of new or existi ng commercial or residential buildings that: i. have achieved, based on third - party assessment greenhouse gas emission performance in the top 15% of their city ii. have received, or expect to receive based on its design, construction and operational plans, certi fication according to third party verified green building standards, such as: ▪ LEED Gold or Platinum standard ▪ other equivalent certification schemes, such as BOMA Best/360, Energy Star 9 IRENA Statute, 2009. http://uat.irena.org/ - /media/Files/IRENA/Agency/About - IRENA/Statute/IRENA_FC_Statute_signed_in_Bonn_26_01_2009_incl_declaration_on_further_authentic_versions.ashx?la=en&hash=FAB 3B5AE51B8082B04A7BBB5BDE978065EF67D96&hash=FAB3B5AE51B8082B04A7BBB5BDE978065EF6 7D96,© Sustainalytics 2017 10 Environmentally sustainable management of natural resources and land us e Purchase and operation of sustainably - managed forest holdings certified to credible third - party forest certification systems, such as: i.

LEED was developed by the non - profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and covers the design, construction, maintenance and operation of buildings. ENERGY STAR is a U.S Environmental Protection Agency voluntary program that helps bu sinesses and individuals save money and protect our climate through superior energy efficiency. Every ENERGY STAR label is independently certified, whether on a product, a home, a building, or a manufacturing plant. Certification is given on an annual bas is, so a building must maintain its high performance to be certified year to year. And the information submitted in the certification application must be verified by a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) or Registered Architect (RA) to be eligible for appr oval. The BOMA 360 Performance Program sets the standard worldwide for operational best practices in the commercial real estate industry. Earning the BOMA 360 label demonstrates that a building is outperforming the competition across all areas of operati ons and management. Certification levels Certified Silver Gold Platinum 1 - 100 ENERGY STAR score Certified Bronze Silver Gold Platinum Areas of assessment: environmental • Energy and atmosphere • Sustainable Sites • Energy efficient products • Operations and management • Security and safety,© Sustainalytics 2017 12 performance of the building • Location and Transportation • Materials and resources • Water efficiency • Indoor environmental quality • Innovation in Design • Regional Priority • Energy savings at home • Energy efficient new homes and apartments • Energy strategies for building s and plants • Training and education • Energy • Environment and sustainability • Tenant relations Requirements (I ndependent of level of certification) + Credits with associated points These points are then added to gether to obtain the LEED level of certification There are several different rating systems within LEED. Each rating system is designed to apply to a specific sector (e.g. New Construction, Major Renovation, Core and Shell Development, Schools - /Retail - /He althcare New Construction and Major Renovations, Existing Buildings: Operation and Maintenance). T o be eligible for ENERGY STAR certification, a building must earn an ENERGY STAR score of 75 or higher, indicating that it performs better than at least 75 p ercent of similar buildings nationwide. Through Portfolio Manager, EPA delivers 1 – 100 ENERGY STAR scores for many types of buildings. The ENERGY STAR score accounts for differences in operating conditions, regional weather data, and other important consi derations. To be eligible for BOMA Best a series of questions must be answered about the building. Each question describes an environmental measure that impacts building management or performance, some being more important than others. Points are attribute d to each question, except for BEST Practices which are minimum requirements. The number of points available per question is calculated as a factor of the impact and impor tance of the measure/initiative. The outcome is a points system that awards more poin ts for taking action where it matters, actions that lead to better understanding of building systems and improved operational performance.

By allocating proceeds of the bond to sustainably - managed timber holdings either certified to the Forest Stewardship Council (F SC) and/or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), Manulife is able to mitigate these risks. Sustainalytics’ is of the opinion that while FSC certification is recognized as the industry best practice, both FSC and PEFC are credibl e certification schemes . An assessment of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the FSC and PEFC certification schemes follows below. Forest Stewardship Council ( FSC ) and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification ( PEFC ), including PEFC’s Am erican certification programme Sustainable Forestry Initiative ( SFI ) , are based on rigorous standards and on a multi - stakeholder structure. Both organizations are in line with international norms such as the International Labor Organization (ILO) conventio ns, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In addition to compliance with laws in the country of certification, both schemes have a set of minimum requi rements that companies are required to meet to obtain and maintain certifications. These requirements include compliance with standards around sustainable management of forests, management of environmental impact of operations, preservation of biodiversity , management of socio - economic and community relations, and sourcing of sustainable wood (chain of custody). Furthermore, both FSC and PEFC require external annual audits to ensure compliance, and achieve and maintain certification. Despite these similar ities, PEFC has faced certain criticisms from civil society actors (e.g. NGOs) . These are highlighted below: i. Type of organization : Since the FSC is an international labeling and certification system, it sets its own global standards. The PEFC, in contrast , is not a standard setter, but a mutual recognition scheme. The PEFC sets sustainability benchmarks according to international norms, and endorses national certification schemes that comply with these benchmarks. A common criticism of this model is that i t allows for more flexibility in the interpretation of international PEFC benchmarks as per regional, cultural, and socio - economic context , and results in the endorsement of potentially less rigorous national certification schemes . However, the process for being endorsed by the PEFC is thorough; a ny national certification system seeking to obtain PEFC endorsement must submit to a comprehensive assessment process, including independent evaluation and public consultation . This evaluation of compliance with in ternational PEFC benchmarks is carried out by independent, accredited certification organizations. ii. Indigenous People’s Rights: FSC and PEFC both identify respect for indigenous peoples’ rights as an important standard in forest management. Both certificat ion schemes require that forest management activities consider and do not infringe on indigenous peoples ’ rights, and the activities are carried out using frameworks and processes that obtain their free and informed consent. A criticism of PEFC is that it requires only engagement with indigenous people in forest management decisions, while the FSC provides performance - oriented targets, and requires forest,© Sustainalytics 2017 14 managers operating on indigenous lands to obtain indigenous people’s consent through binding agreement s. iii. Sourcing wood from non - certified sources: Both FSC and the PEFC have established standards around sourcing wood from non - certified and controversial sources. FSC’s standards direct forest managers to avoid wood harvested in violation of traditional an d civil rights. A criticism of the comparable PEFC certification is that it limits identification of controversially sourced wood to situations where the local legislation is violated. However, PEFC standards explicitly reference the violation of local, na tional, and international legislation with regards to worker’s and indigenous people’s rights as being a controversial source of wood.,© Sustainalytics 2017 15 A pp endix 4 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form Green Bond / Green Bond Prog ramme External Review Form Section 1.

PROCESS FOR PROJECT EVALUATION AND SELECTION Overall comment on section: Manulife ha s established the following process for project evaluation and selection: 1. Senior officer(s) on the investment team will identify and propose potential green assets to the Sustainability Accounting for review 2. Sustainability Accounting reviews the ide ntified green assets to ensure they comply with Eligibility Criteria and the overall Manulife’s Green Bond Framework. If Sustainability Accounting concurs that the potential green assets comply with the Framework, then the recommendation is made to the Man ulife Green Bond Council 3. The Manulife Green Bond Council, which is made up of members of senior management of Manulife, including the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Investment Officer and the Treasurer, is responsible for the ultimate review and sel ection of the green assets that will qualify as Eligible Assets, to which the net proceeds of a Green Bond issuance will be allocated. Sustainalytics considers this to be in line with recommended market best practice. Sustainalytics recognizes that some projects , such as those to be financed and refinanced by the Green B onds proceeds, come with environmental risks, mainly related to the environmental impact of the construction and operation of renewable energy projects . However, given the level of social and environmental due diligence performed and the regulatory framework of the countries in which Manulife makes its investments , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Manulife is well positioned to address environmental and social risks with the projects f inanced by the proceeds of the Green Bond. Evaluation and selection ☒ Defined and transparent criteria for projects eligible for Green Bond proceeds ☒ Documented process to determine that projects fit within defined categories ☒ Summary criteria for project evaluation and selection publicly available ☐ Other (ple ase specify): Information on Responsibilities and Accountability ☒ Evaluation / Selection criteria subject to external advice or verification (CBI verification achieved for inaugural bond) ☐ In - house assessment ☐ Other (please specify) :,© Sustainalytics 2017 18 3. M ANAGEMENT OF PROCEEDS Overall comment on section : Manulife will establish a Green Bond Register to record on an ongoing basis the allocation of the ne t proceeds from the Green Bond issuance to Eligible Assets. The net proceeds from each Green Bond issuanc e will be deposited in the general fund accounts and an amount equal to the net proceeds will be earmarked for allocation to Eligible Assets in accordance with the Manulife Green Bond Framework. Manulife aims for Green Bond proceeds to be fully allocated within 18 months of the Green Bond issuance. Any portion of the net proceeds of Green Bonds that have not been allocated to Eligible Assets in the Green Bond Register will be invested in cash or liquid securities in accordance with Manulife’s normal liqui dity management policy. The Green Bond Register will contain relevant information to identify each Green Bond and the Eligible Assets relating to it, including the asset’s location, financed amount, and the applicable eligibility category. The Green Bond Register will form the basis for the impact reporting. Payment of principal and interest on any Green Bond issuance will be made from the general funds and will not be directly linked to the performance of any Eligible Assets.
