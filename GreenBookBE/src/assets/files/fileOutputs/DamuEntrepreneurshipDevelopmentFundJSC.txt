Terms and methodology This note provides GFC’s s econd o pinion (“ Opinion ”) of the Issuer ’s F ramework dated June 20 20 . This Opinion remains relevant to all G reen B onds and/or loans issued under this F ramework for the duration of three years from publication of this Opinion , if the F ramework remains unchanged. Any amendments or updates to the F rame work require a revised Opinion . GFC encourages the Issuer to make this Opinion publicly available. If any part of the Opinion is quoted, the full report must be made available. The Opinion is based on a review of the F ramework and documentation of the Issuer ’s policies and processes, as well as information gathered during meetings, teleconferences, and email correspondence. An assessment of compliance with the four core components of GBP , namely: Use of Proceeds, Proces s for Project Evaluation and Selection , Management of Proceeds and Reporting is made in preparing the Opinion , by applying a weighted grade to the criteria measured as per methodology . Particularly, the O pinion is formed under the following two - step process based on the assessment criteria: 1. Opinion on compliance / non - compliance of the Issuer’s Framework with the GBP. In this context, it is expected that the minimum threshold levels are met for all assessment criteria to verify that Issuer’s Framework c omplies with the GBP . 2. Opinion on the level of greenness ranging from “Excellent” (High) to “Poor” (Low) is provided in accordance with the “ Grading scale for the level of greenness ”. In this context, an assessment is made by measuring a weighted grade for the criteria considering their significance . Therefore, any level of greenness, except for “Poor” , should be considered as consistent with the GBP. Table 1 .

Brief description of Damu Fund ’s Green Bond Framework and Related Policies The Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund JSC is a national development establishment whose goal is to promote first - class development of entrepreneurship in Kazakhstan by providing financial support. The Fund provides a wide range of products and services for entrepreneurs such as lending through second - tier banks, microfinance companies, leasing companies, subsidized interest rates, loan guarantees, consulting, providing information and analytical materials . The Fund operates in all the regions of Kazakhstan. The regional network consists of 16 branches in all regional centers as well as in the cities of Nur - Sultan and Almaty. In addition, the entrepreneur support infrastructure includes 18 Entrepreneur Servi ce Centers and 14 Mobile business support centers . In accordance with the Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 571 of May 22, 2013, “On measures for optimizing administration of system development institutions, financial institutions a nd development of the national economy,” 100% of shares of Damu Fund were transferred to Baiterek National Managing Holding JSC. Environmental Strategies and Policies The Damu Fund is aware of the importance of its impact on the economy, the environment and society to ensure sustainable development in the long term while respecting the balance of interests of stakeholders. So, in 2013 the Damu Fund adopted the “ Corporate Social Responsibility Policy ” ( “ CSR Policy ” ) with the purpose of ensuring that activities of the Damu Fund are in accordance with the corporate social responsibility principles and to strength en trustful relationships with all stakeholders . Recognising the principles of the UN Global Impact, observing the rule of law, the Damu Fund is guided by the following CSR principles in environmental protection: • support for the approach to environmental issues, based on the principles of precaution and prevention of negative impacts on the environment; • adoption of initiatives aimed at increasing responsibility for the environment; • promoting the development and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies; • supporting initiatives in the use of alternative energy s ources, reduced energy consumption and improved energy efficiency. As part of the implementation of this CSR Policy, the Damu Fund in 2018 approved its “ Environmental P olicy ” , an environmental management system designed to prevent and reduce excessive damage to the environment during the implementation of the main activities of the Damu Fund for the development of small and medium - sized businesses in the Republic of Kazakhstan. Therefore, the Damu Fund seeks , by informing involved financial institutions and presenting,8 environmental requirements to them , to facilitate the adoption by involved financial institutions of timely measures to prevent negative environmental impacts during the implementation of programs. According to “ Action P lan I mplementation R eport to S trengthen C orporate S ocial R esponsibility for 2018 ” , the Damu Fund planned t o use energy - saving technologies and to reduc e the level of electricity consumption by 10% compared to 2017 , to r educe paper consumption by business processes automatisation. In the “ Corporate Governance Code ” ( “ Code ” ) of Damu Fund the principles of sustainable development is d efined , which are openness, accountability, transparency, ethical conduct, safeguarding the interests of the parties concerned, the rule of law, respect for human rights, intolerance to corruption and inadmissibility of conflicts of interest. T he environmental component contributes to minimizing the impact on biological and physical natural systems, optimal use of limited resources, application of environmentally friendly, energy and material - saving technologies. The Board of Directors and the Management Board ensure that an appropriate sustainable development system is established and implemented. Al l employees and officials at all levels contribute to sustainable development. The Damu Fund is developing a sustainable development plan . Sustainable development is recommended to be integrated into: 1) management system; 2) development strategy; 3) key processes, including risk management, planning (long - term (strategy), medium - term (5 - year development plan) and short - term (annual budget) periods), reporting, risk management, management of human resources, investments, operating activities and others, an d also in decision - making processes at all levels from bodies (the Sole Shareholder, the Board of Directors, the Management Board), to ordinary employees. Moreover, annually Damu Fund prepares a “ R eport on C ompliance / n on - C ompliance with the P rinciples E n shrined in the Corporate Governance Code ” ( “Compliance Report ” ) . According to this Compliance R eport 2019, in April 2019 “ Policy in the F ield of S ustainable D evelopment ” (the “Sustainable P olicy ” ) had been developed and approved ( protocol No. 03/2019) . The purpose of the Sustainable Policy is to determine the fundamental norms, principles, rules, and approaches that the Damu Fund must adhere to in building a management system in the field of sustainable development. In accordance with the requirements of the Sustainable Policy: 1) t he Management Board approves the “ Action Plan in the F ield of S ustainable D evelopment ” (Protocol of the Management Board of the Fund dated December 10, 2019, No. 150/2019) and on an annual ba sis a n “Action Plan Implementation Report ” is produce d; 2) t he structural units of the Damu Fund implement activities in areas of sustainable development.,9 S ustainable development activities are also included in the “ Action P lan I mplementation R eport for 2019 - 2021 on Development Strategy for 2014 - 2023 ” . In addition, as part of strategic integration, it is planned to update the Fund's Development Strategy by considering the goals and objectives of the Fund in the field of sustainable development. Damu Fund established cooperation with the UNDP Kazakhstan (“UNDP”) to engage micro, small and medium - sized enterprises (“MSMEs”) in the implementation of G reen P rojects. Thus, a financial support program was developed for entrepreneurs engaged in investment projects related to energy - saving technologies under the project “Sustainable C ities for L ow - C a rbon D evelopment ” implemented by the UNDP jointly with the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan and with the financial support of the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The details of this programs are described in the Framework. Additionally, Damu Fund together with the UNDP on 24 th of February 2020 signed the General Agreement with the Responsible Party between UNDP Kazakhstan and Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund JSC within the UNDP - GEF project “Derisking Renewable Energy Investment” (“Agreement”) , aimed at stimulating and ass isting in the development of renewable energy projects. Under this Agreement , MSMEs will be provided with financial support for the implementation of renewable energy projects by applying one of the following financial mechanisms: 1) S ubsidi s ing of the interest rate on the loan up to 10% ; 2) Subsidi s ing of a portion of the main loan up to 30 %; 3) The issuance of Green Bonds by the Damu Fund to finance renewable energy projects. Under the Agreement, the initial reduction in the coupon rate on the Green Bonds of the Damu Fund is expected, which will entail a reduction in the cost of attracted resources, respectively, a reduction in the interest rate on MSMEs loans. In accordance w ith this cooperation mechanism between the Damu Fund and the UNDP, the Damu Fund intends to finance Green Projects through the conditional allocation of funds in second - tier banks (“STBs”) and m icrofinance i nstitutions (“MFIs”). Corresponding rules are: 1) Rules on provision of financial support for business under the Project of UNDP - GEF and the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan “Sustainable cities for low carbon development”; 2) Rules on the provision of financial support for the implementation of the risk mitigation mechanism for investing in small renewable energy projects. We consider that all policies of the Damu Fund reflect their strong commitment to the principles of environmental sustainability. The Damu Fund has developed the Framework under which it is considering issuing Green Bonds . The Framework describes:,10 Use of Proceeds The Damu Fund will allocate proceeds raised under the issuance of Green Bonds to finance and refinance, in whole or in part, existing and future eligible Green Projects, falling under following eligible categories (“Eligible Green Assets”): renewable energy, energy efficiency, pollution prevention and control, environmentally sustaina ble management of living natural resources and land use, terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity conservation, clean transportation, sustainable water and wastewater management, climate change adaptation, eco - efficient and/or circular economy adapted products , production technologies and processes, green buildings. Therefore, Damu Fund expects that more than 90% proceeds will go to finance new eligible Green Projects. The Eligible Green Assets are intended to contribute to five main sustainability objectives: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, natural resource conservation, biodiversity conservation, and pollution prevention and control , and to seven of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (“SDG”): SDG 6. Clean Water and Sanitati on; SDG 7. Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. SDG 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 12. Responsible Consumption and Production; SDG 13. Climate Action; SDG 15. Life on Land. At the first stage, it is plan ned to issue Green Bonds, which will be used to finance small - scale (small) renewable energy projects. At subsequent stages, subject to demand and conditions, the Damu Fund considers issuing bonds in other areas, such as: • energy efficiency; • large - scale renewable energy sources; • other directions. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection The STB / MFIs and UNDP are involved in search ing for MSMEs planning or implementing renewable energy projects. The MSMEs apply to the STBs / MFIs for consideration of financing the renewable energy project s . After receiving a preliminary decision by the STBs / MFIs, the latter sends to the Damu Fund a package of documents on the renewable energy project s . Within the established cooperation between the Damu Fund and the UNDP and the relevant Agreement, for projects evaluation and selection procedure in accordance with the Framework, Unified Progr am and developed Product Passports, Damu Fund created a Working Group on Green Bonds (“Working Group”), which includes the Damu Fund’s structural units responsible for raising and allocating funds (Funding and International Relations Department, Apex Depar tment and Program Instruments Department), also involving, if necessary, other structural units and external experts. After receiving the conclusion of the Working Group, the interested structural unit of the Damu Fund sends a confirmation of compliance o f the project with the conditions of the Product Passport to the STBs / MFIs .,11 The project to be considered by the Working Group, the procedure for interaction with the STBs / MFIs and other issues are determined by the internal documents of the Damu Fund. Management of Proceeds The Damu Fund plans to designate a special account to w hich the net proceeds from the issuance of G reen B onds will be allocated. The total amount of the net proceeds of the Green Bonds will be allocated to a separate account at the settlement date. The Issuer has put in place an internal accounting system to ensure the appropriate earmarking of the Green Portfolio and the tracking o f proceeds until Green Bond’s maturity date. The Working Group on Green Bonds will quarterly verify that the net proceeds match the Green Portfolio until the Bond’s maturity date. In addition, an independent party will verify annually the allocation of fu nds once all Geen Bond’s proceeds will be allocated within the annual external auditing procedures performed by appointed independent audit company . The Damu Fund has also clearly disclosed that the unallocated funds will be temporarily managed in accordance with Rules on allocat ion of temporarily free funds . Reporting The Damu Fu nd is planning to report both on the u se of p roceeds and on the expected impact of projects . The Green Bond reporting is planned to be published annually on Damu Fund’s corporate website until full allocation of Green Bond proceeds and on a timely basis in case of material developments . Use of p roceeds reporting will include a list of the projects to which Green Bond proceeds have been allocated, as well as a brie f description of the projects and the amounts allocated . Along with this, net proceeds raised from each Damu Fund’s Green Bond, aggregate amounts of funds allocated to each eligible category and the balance of unallocated proceeds at the reporting period. Impact reporting will include in accordance with each eligible category qualitative performance indicators and, where feasible, quantitative performance measures ( energy capacity, electricity generation, greenhouse gas emissions reduced/avoided, number of people provided with access to clean power, decrease in water use, reduction in the number of cars required, etc.) . Disclosure of information related to the u se of p roceeds, i mpact r eporting, and projects financed or refinanced will be made subject to Damu’s confidentiality obligations and the availability of information.,12 3 . Assessment of Damu Fund’s Green Bond Framework and Policies In this section, we describe the evaluation of the Issuer ’s Framework and other relevant documents for compliance with the GBP under the GFC’s M ethodology . Assessment by the c riterion “Use of Proceeds” The net proceeds of the Green Bonds will exclusively finance or refinance, in full or in part, new and/or existing projects falling under ten eligible categories (“Eligible Green Assets”), namely: renewable energy, energy efficiency, pollution prevention and control, environmentally sustainable m anagement of living natural resources and land use, terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity conservation, clean transportation, sustainable water and wastewater management, climate change adaptation, eco - efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, pro duction technologies and processes, green buildings . We consider the eligible categories are clearly defined. The Eligible Green Assets are intended to contribute to five main sustainability objectives : climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, natural resource conservation, biodiversity conservation, and pollution prevention and control. We consider the intended objectives are relevant and overall, clearly defined. The Eligible Green Assets are expected to provide clear environmental benefits. The Issuer has committed it will assess and, where feasible, quantify most of the expected environmental benefits of the Green Bonds in its annual Green Bond reports. Additionally, the Eligible Green Assets are likely to contribute to seven of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (“SDG”): SDG 6. Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG 7. Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. SDG 11. Sustainable Cities a nd Communities; SDG 12. Responsible Consumption and Production; SDG 13. Climate Action; SDG 15. Life on Land. Table 2. Indicator of the criterion “Use of Proceeds” Indicator Grade Compliance with the GBP Compliance with the threshold Weighted grade > 90% of raised funds are allocated to implementing and financing/refinancing of green projects that bring environmental benefits and are evaluated by the Issuer for compliance with the eligible project categories in line with the GBP with regard to their qu alitative and/or quantitative characteristics 5 Yes Yes 2.25,13 Assessment by the c riterion “Process for Project Evaluation and Selection” The governance and the process for the evaluation and selection of the Eligible Green Assets is clearly defined and formalised in the Framework. We consider it’s reasonably structured, transparent and relevant. The evaluation and selection of Eligible Gree n Assets is clearly defined and reasonably structured, based on relevant internal expertise, with well - defined roles and responsibilities . Thus, the STB / MFIs and UNDP are involved in searching for MSMEs planning or implementing renewable energy projects. The MSMEs apply to the STBs / MFIs for consideration of financing the renewable energy projects. After receiving a preliminary decision by the STBs / MFIs, the latter sends to the Damu Fund a package of documents on the renewable energy projects. Th us , for evaluation and selection of projects as per stipulated eligibility criteria defined in the Framework, Unified P rogram and Product Passpor ts , the Working Group is created consisting of the Damu Fund’s structural units responsible for raising and allocating funds and also involving, if necessary, other structural units and external experts. The selection and evaluation process relies on explicit eligibility criteria (selection and exclusion), overall relevant to the environmental objectives defined for the e ligible c ategories of assets. The eligibility requirements are based on the definition s of the Eligible Green Assets defined in the Framework, Unified Program and Product Passports . The Issuer also explicitly defined exclusionary criteria. Table 3. Indicators of the criterion “Process for Project Evaluation and Selection” Indicator Score 1.
