C O M / E S G 3 o f 2 7 Scope of work Raiffeisen b ank a . s . (“ Raiffeisen b ank ” or “the issuer”) commissioned ISS ESG to assist wi th its Green B ond programme by assessing th ree core elements to determine the sustainability quality of the instrument : 1. Green bond programme link to Raiffeisen b ank’s sustainability strategy – drawing on Raiffeisen b ank s ustainability profile and issuance - sp ecific Use of Proceeds categories. 2. Raiffeisen b ank’s Green Bond Framework ( May 2021 version) – benchmarked against the International Capital Market Association's ( ICMA ) Green Bond Principles (GBPs ). 3. The Selection criteria – whether the projects contribute p ositively to the UN SDG s and perform against ISS ESG ’s issue - specific key performance indicators (KPIs) (See Annex 2 ). ISS ESG ASSESSMENT SUMMARY 1 ISS ESG ’s evaluation is based on the Raiffeisen b ank a.s.’s Green Bond Framework ( May 2021 version), on the analysed Selection criteria as received on the 16 .04.2021, and on the ISS ESG Corporate Rating applicable at the SPO delivery date (updated on the 18.06.2020). 2 As Raiffeisenbank a.s. is not part of the ISS ESG Universe and is a subsidiary of Raiffeisen Bank International AG, the paren t’s ESG performan ce has been introduced for this assessment. SPO SECTION SUMMARY EVALUATION 1 Part 1 : Green bond programme link to issuer’s sustainability strategy Accord ing to the ISS ESG Corporate Rating published on 1 8.0 6 .202 0 , Raiffeisen Bank International AG 2 shows a high sustainability performance against the industry peer group on key ESG issues faced by the Commercial Banks & Capital Markets sector . Raiffeisen Bank International AG is rated 5 th out of 287 companies within its sector . The Use of Proceeds financed through this bond are consistent with the issuer’s sustainability strategy and material ESG topics for the issuer’s industry. The rationale for issuing gre en bonds is clearly described by the issuer. Consistent with issuer’s sustainability strategy Part 2 : Alignment with GBPs The issuer has defined a formal concept for its Green bond programme regarding use of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the Green Bond Principles . Aligned Part 3 : Sust ainability quality of the Selection criteria The overall sustainability quality of the Selection criteria in terms of sustainabil ity benefits, risk avoidance and minimisation is good based upon the ISS ESG assessment. The Green bond programme will (re - )fin ance eligible asset categories including : green buildings, renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean transportation, agriculture and forestry. Those use of proceed s categories have a positive contribution to SDGs 3 ’ Good health and well - being ’, 7 ‘Affordable and clean energy’ , 11 ‘Sustainable cities and communities’, 12 ‘Responsible consumption and production’ , 13 ‘Climate action’ and 15 ‘Life on land’ . The environmental and social risks associated with those use of proceeds categories have been we ll managed.

ESG performance As of 1 2 .0 5 .20 21 , this Rating places Raiffeisen Bank International AG 5 th out of 2 87 companies rated by ISS ESG in the Commercial Banks & Capital Markets sector . Key c hallenges faced by companies in term s of sustainability management in this sector are displayed in the chart on the right, as well as the issuer’s performance against those key challenges in comparis on to the average industry peers’ performance. Sustainability Opportunities Through special p roduct offerings in the areas of social and/or green financial services, as well as by offering socially responsible investment (SRI) products, financial institut ions can promote investments in companies that contribute to the solution of global sustainabi lity challenges. Raiffeisen Bank International Group (RBI) finances projects for water supply facilities, wastewater systems, schools and kindergartens. In additi on, the company finances solar and wind power projects as well as energy efficiency technologi es. The company also offers several SRI funds and provides information regarding the carbon emissions of the funds. However, the above - mentioned activities and pr oducts do not constitute the main business of the company. 3 As Raiffeisen Bank Czech Republic is not part of the ISS ESG Uni verse and is a subsidiary of Raiffeisen Bank International AG, the parent’s ESG performance has been introduced for this assessment.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en b on d p ro gr a m m e I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 5 o f 2 7 Sustainability Risks For its lending business, RBI has established some general environmental and social provisions. For instance, it excludes the financing of nuclear power plant construction proj ects or operators of nuclear power plants. The company is also committed to neither lend ing to mining, energy and trading companies that derive more than 25 percent of their revenues from thermal coal, nor providing financial or refinancing services to the rmal coal power plants or mines. In addition, one of RBI's subsidiaries (Raiffeisen Roma nia) applies the International Finance Corporation's Performance Standards. For its mainstream mutual funds, the company excludes investments in agricultural commoditie s and controversial weapons. In the field of customer and product responsibility, the co mpany has implemented several relevant measures to ensure responsible marketing and sales practices as well as responsible treatment of clients with debt repayment prob lems (e.g. pre - emptive actions and debt counseling). There is no indication of significa nt measures to ensure tax compliance of wealth management clients, though. In several locations, the company offers a high degree of workplace flexibility and supports access to childcare facilities. RBI has established a group - wide code of conduct coverin g important issues, such as corruption, antitrust violations, insider dealings, and conflicts of interest, in a varying degree of in detail. The company conducts compre hensive compliance trainings, risk assessments and third - party anti - corruption due dilig ence measures. It also offers its employees confidential channels to report on non - compliance issues as well as whistleblower protection . Governance opinion The majo rity of the members of the supervisory board is not independent 4 including the chair of the board, Mr. Erwin Hameseder (as at January 8, 2020). The audit, remuneration, and nomination committees are primarily composed of non - independent directors as well. Many s upervisory board members are representatives of regional Raiffeisen banks. The issue of independence of the board members may pose risks to the decision making of the company. The company discloses its remuneration policy for executives, including lo ng - ter m components, which could incentivize sustainable value creation. The company has no supervisory - board - level sustainability committee and there seem to be no relevant sustainability performance targets considered in executive remuneration plans. In t erms o f business ethics and compliance, RBI has established a group - wide code of conduct covering important issues, such as corruption, antitrust violations, insider dealings, and conflicts of interest, in a varying degree of detail. The company conducts c ompreh ensive compliance trainings, compliance risk assessments and third - party anti - corruption due diligence measures. It also offers its employees confidential channels to report on non - compliance issues as well as whistleblower protection. Sustainability impac t of products and services portfolio Using a proprietary methodology, ISS ESG assessed the contribution of RBI’ s current products and services portfolio to the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations (UN SDGs). This analysis is li mited to the evaluation of final product characteristics and does not include practices along RBI production process . 4 The superv isory board independency is in line with local legislation. https://www.rbinternational.com/en/investors/corporate - governance/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/contentcontainer_360169373/contentplus/downloadlist.download.html/0/Austr ian%20Co de% 20of%20Corporate%20Governance%20as%20amended%20in%20January%202021.pdf,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en b on d p ro gr a m m e I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

B. CONSISTENCY OF GREEN BOND PROGRAMME WITH RAIFFEISENBANK ’S SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY Key sustainability objectives and priorities defined by the issue r Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) Group is a signatory of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) and shows its comm itment to consistently complying with the ten UNGC principles of responsible business. In this context, global responsibility is expected of all em ployees and managers as well as from partners and suppliers of the RBI Group. In January 2021 , RBI signed the global UN Principles for Responsible Banking 5 . Being the first Austrian banking group who signed the UN PRB , RBI has demonstrated its pioneering role particularly in Austria. The Principles for Responsible Banking set out the banking indus try’s role and responsibility and in aligning the banking sector with the objectives of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement 6 They also, importantly, enable a bank to embed sustainability across all its business areas, and to identify where it has the potential to make the most impact in its contributions to a sustainable world. Furthermore, in March 2021 RBI has yet again high lighted its focus on renewable energy initiatives and the Management Board has adopted a guid eline according to which the RBI Group's carbon finance portfolio, i.e. the sum of loans relating to thermal coal and thermal coal trading will be significantly re duced 7 . In the future , no business will be done with companies that generate more than 25 pe r cent of their revenues from thermal coal mining. The same applies by analogy to energy and trading companies. No new credit exposures will be entered into for exi sting such customers, and their outstanding balance must be repaid by 2030 at the latest. Wi th this strategic decision RBI Group is taking an important step on the way to achieving the EU climate targets 8 and Raiffeisen B ank Czech Republic as part of the R BI Group is committed to follow these guidelines. The renewable energy initiative is consi stent with RBI's ESG program, which aims to achieve strong growth in the green and social finance segment in Austria and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). 5 UN PRB is a single framework for a sustainable banking industry developed through an innovative partnership between banks worldwide and United Nations Environment’s Finance Initiativ e: Raiffeisen Bank International becomes Signatory of the global Principles for Responsible Banking - https://www.rbinternational.com/ 6 Principles for Responsible Banking – United Nations Environ ment – Finance Initiative https://www.unepfi.org/ 7 Focus on renewable energy_ phase - out of thermal coal.pdf https://www.rbinternational.com/ 8 https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en b on d p ro gr a m m e I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 7 o f 2 7 Concentra ting on Raiffeisen Bank Czech Republic sustainability stra tegy , the bank has based it’s strategy on three pillars : Responsible banker , f air partner and a ctive corporate citizen , which are deeply rooted in the group’s organizational culture, with the aim to connect business activity to sustainable development both in society an d in the public sphere. Raiffeisen Bank Czech Republic has signed the Sustainable Finance Memorandum of the Czech banking association (CBA - Česká bankovní asociace), where banks are c ommitted to assess their activities in the light of the requirements for environmentally and socially responsible business, and to align their objectives with the objectives stated in the relevant UN global agreements, EU programs and policies as well as w ith national sustainable policy frameworks. The CBA Sustainable Finance Memorandum is a follow - up to the UN Principles for Responsible Banking and binds the signing banks to apply sustainability principles in the business activities and also in relation to clients, suppliers and other stakeholders. Rationale for issu ance The banking sector plays a vital role in mobilizing financial resources that contribute to building and developing a sustainable society in the Czech Republic . Raiffeisenbank a . s . has esta blished this Green Bond Framework (“the Framework”) as a part of its br oader sustainability strategy with the aim to focus on assets with a positive environmental impact in order to support the necessary transition to an environmentally sustainable future. The use of proceeds categories included in the bank’s Green Bond Progr amme are renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings , agriculture and forestry. All the selected proceeds categories are aligned with the categories eligible under the ICMA Gre en Bond Principles and aligns with Raiffeisen Bank Czech Republic’s sus tainability strategy. Contribution of Use of Proceeds categories to sustainability objectives and priorities ISS ESG mapped the Use of Proceeds categories financed under this Green bon d programme with the sustainability objectives defined by the issuer, a nd with the key ESG industry challenges as defined in the ISS ESG Corporate Rating methodology for the Commercial Banks & Capital Markets sector . Key ESG industry challenges are key iss ues that are highly relevant for a respective industry to tackle when i t comes to sustainability, e.g. climate change and energy efficiency in the buildings sector. From this mapping, ISS ESG derived a level of contribution to the strategy of each Use of P roceeds categories.

Use of Proceeds An amount equivalent to the net proceeds raised by the issuance of Green Bonds shall be used to finance or re - finance, in part or in full, new or existing Eligible Loans providing distinct environmental benefits (“Eligible Green Loans”). Eligible Loans can be loans provided by Raiffeisen bank a . s . or loans/ leases provided by its subsidiary Raiffeisen – Leasing s.r.o. Eligible Green Loans may include loans or leases to private individuals (mortgages), legal entities, municipalities and public sector (project finance or investment finance). Raiffeis enbank will continuously exercise its professional judgement, discretion and sustainability expertise when identifying the Eligible Green Loans and will strive to replace maturing Eligible Green Loans with the new ones and will provide transparenc y on the Green Loan origination timeframe in its annual reporting. Eligible Green Loans are loans to finance assets dedicated to the following Eligible Categories: Eligible ELIGIBLE CATEGORY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Green Buildings Finance or refinance Eligi ble Green Loans or investments in green assets or projects related to the construction of new buildings, acquisition and ownership of existing buildings or renovation of existing buildings (with a minimum energy efficiency upgrade) in the commercial a nd re tail real estate sector 9 : Green commercial and residential buildings will meet at least one of the following criteria: • Building has a recognized certification (at least applied or precertified) and a minimum certification level of LEED Gold, BREEAM Very Go od 10 , DGNB/ÖGNI Gold or Edge Advanced, • OR building belongs to the top 15% of low carbon buildings in the respective country based on local building codes, building years and EPC certificates (if an assessment is possible) • OR in cases where an assessment of the top 15% low carbon buildings is not possible, Raiffeisenbank will define buildings with the EPC with a min. level A as eligible Refurbished buildings (e.g. insulation of walls and roofs, insulation of facades, roofs, replacement of boile rs) leading to reduction of Primary Energy Demand of at least 30% in comparison with the energy performance of the building before the renovation.

C O M / E S G 1 2 o f 2 7 Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Use of Proceeds description provided by Raiffeisenbank a.s ’s . Green Bond Framework as aligned with the Green Bond Principles . Environmental benefits are described and quantified for some o f the categories . Furthermore, the issuer will, on a best effort basis, select assets according to the e ligible criteria as per the April 2021 version of the EU Taxonomy, reflecting good market practices. 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection The evaluation and selection process for Eligible Green Loans is a key process in ensuring that the amount e quivalent to the net proceeds from Gree n Bonds is allocated to assets and activities which meet the criteria in the Framework. All potential Eligible Green Loans are subject to Raiffeisenbank’s standard credit process in line with the normal course of bu siness and only loans that have been ap proved through this process can be considered for Green Bond eligibility. Raiffeisenbank’s Green Bond Committee (“GBC”) is responsible for ensuring that allocations are made to Eligible Green Loans as specified in the use of proceeds section above and to o versee the entire issuance process. The GBC is composed of members of the local Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) which includes representatives from Risk, Business, Treasury. Hence GBC represents a sub - comm ittee of ALCO and meets on a monthly ba sis in the frame of the ALCO meeting and until full allocation of the proceeds. The Green Bond Committee will be responsible for: • Ensuring the potential Eligible Green Loans are aligned with the categories and eligib ility criteria as specified in the Use of Proceeds section above, and approving any proposed changes to the eligible Green Loan Portfolio in the event that the Loans no longer meet the eligibility criteria. • Ensuring the proposed allocations are aligned wit h the relevant general company policies and company’s ESG strategy. • Approving the Green Bond Reporting . The loans are assessed in accordance with their social and environmental impact, thanks to a several stages selection process:,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en b on d p ro gr a m m e I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 3 o f 2 7 Exclusions Raiffeisenb ank Czech Republic explicitly excludes financing loans for activities or projects involving: • nuclear energy generation, weapons and munitions, mining, hazardous chemicals (gasoline, kerosene, and other petroleum products), tobacco, gambling, wood or other fo restry products other than from sustainably managed forests, forced/child labor. Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Process for Project Evaluation and Selection description provided by Raiffeisenbank a.s. ’s Green Bond Framework as aligned with the Green Bon d Principles . Moreover, the projects selected show alignment with the sustainability strategy of the issuer. Furthermore, the issuer has created a green bond committee composed of different departments reflecting best market p ractices. Lastly, Raiffeisen b a nk has put in place exclusion criteria, reflecting best market practices. Stage 1 • Regular Credit Process • In the normal course of the credit process loans are screened on their CSR relevance (entityspecific thresholds) Stage 2 • Pre - screening • Raiffeisenbank's local business segments identify the potential Eligible Green Loans and prepare supporting documentation • All necessary data is gathered by the bank's Corporate Development department who will then identify and evaluate the green loans Stage 3 • Analysis of potential Eligible Green Loans • The counterparty and the asset are fully evaluated by Corporate Development department, including the assessment of the Eligible Green Loans from the credit portfolio management perspective (industry, rating etc) • The Eligible Green Loans are presented to the Green Bond Committee (GBC) to include Eligible • Green Loans to the Eligible Green Loan Portfolio and to enter in the Green Bond Register Stage 4 • Green Bond Committee (GBC) • The GBC takes the decisions to include/exclude Eligible Green Loans in/from the Eligible Green • Loan Portfolio • The GBC takes place monthly as a regular part of ALCO meeting until full allocation or in case of material changes in the portfolio. GBC reviews the Green Bond Register Stage 5 • Monitoring and reporting • Raiffeisenbank's Risk department monitores the Eligible Green Loan Portfolio on a regular basis • Raiffeisenbank's Coroprate Development department prepares the Green Bond reporting; • The GBC approves the Green Bond reporting,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en b on d p ro gr a m m e I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 4 o f 2 7 3. Management of Proceeds An amount equivalent to the net proceeds of any Raiffeisenbank Green Bonds will be managed by the Risk department on a portfoli o basis. Raiffeisenbank’s Corp orate Development department is responsible for collecting and monitoring all relevant data for the evaluation and selection of Eligible Green Loans which will then be presented to the GBC on regular basis. Raiffeisenbank a . s . will strive to regularly add Eligible Green Loans to the Eligible Green Loan Portfolio so that a full allocation of an amount at least equal to the proceeds of the green bonds is achieved until maturity of the bonds. All Eligible Green Loans to be include d in the Eligible Green Loan P ortfolio are entered in Raiffeisenbank’s Green Bond Register managed by the bank’s Risk department. The Green Bond Register assures that the Eligible Green Loans are not externally refinanced. Raiffeisenbank a.s . aims to fully allocate the Green Bond proce eds within 36 months upon issuance. On an annually basis, the issuer will check the eligibility and availability of the Eligible Green Loans in the Green Bond Register. Raiffeisenbank will strive to substitute an y redeemed or maturing Eligible Green Loans with other eligible Green Loans and/or if any such loans cease to be an Eligible Green Loan, as soon as practicable once an appropriate substitution option has been identified. Pending the allocation or reallocat ion, as the case might be, of an amount equi valent to the net proceeds of Raiffeisen bank Green Bonds to the Eligible Green Loans, the bank will invest the balance of the net proceeds within the Raiffeisenbank treasury, in money market instruments, cash an d/or cash equivalents instruments. Opinion: I SS ESG finds that Management of Proceeds proposed by Raiffeisenbank a.s. ‘s Green Bond Framework is aligned with the Green Bond Principles . The issuer has committed to track the proceeds in an appropriate manner and has disclosed the intended types of tempo rary investment instruments for unallocated proceeds. 4. Reporting Raiffeisenbank a . s . has the ambition to publish an annual report 16 on the use of proceeds from any Green Bonds outstanding under this framework, including a description of its Eligible Green Loan Portfolio. Reporting will be provided on an annual basis until full allocation, and thereafter if there are any material chang es to the Eligible Green Loan portfolio, until the maturity of Raiffeisenbank’s Green Bonds.

C O M / E S G 2 2 o f 2 7 © 202 1 | Institutional Shareholder Services and/or its affiliates ANNEX 1 : Methodology ISS ESG G REE N KPIs The ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs serve as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality – i.e. the social and environmental added value – of the use of proceeds of Raiffeisenbank a . s . ’s Green bond programme . It comprises firstly the definition o f the use of proceeds category offering added social and/or environmental value, and secondly the specific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the a ssets can be clearly identified and d escribed. The sustainability criteria are complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measurement of the sustainability performance of the assets and which can also be used for reporting. If a majori ty of assets fulfill the requirement of an indicator, this indicator is then assessed positively. Those indicators may be tailor - made to capture the context - specific environmental and social risks. To review the KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Feder ico Pezzolato (details below) who wil l send them directly to you. Environmental and social risks assessment methodology ISS ESG evaluates whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eligible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bon d KPIs. All percentages refer to the amount of assets within one category (e.g. wind power). Additionally, the assessment “no or limited information is available” either indicates that no information was made available to ISS ESG or that the information p rovided did not fulfil the requiremen ts of the ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs. The evaluation was carried out using information and documents provided to ISS ESG on a confidential basis by RAIFFEISENBANK (e.g. Due Diligence Reports). Further, national legislation and standards, depending on the asse t location, were drawn on to complement the information provided by the issuer. Assessment of the contribution and association to the SDG The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed in September 2015 by th e United Nations and provide a benchm ark for key opportunities and challenges toward a more sustainable future. Using a proprietary method, ISS ESG identifies the extent to which Raiffeisenbank a . s . ’s Green bond programme contributes to related SDGs.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en b on d p ro gr a m m e I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 2 3 o f 2 7 ANNEX 2 : ISS ESG Corporate Rating Method ology The following pages contain methodology description of the ISS ESG Corporate Rating .,Raiffeisen Bank International AG Methodology - Overview The ESG Corporate Rating methodology was originally developed by Institutional Shareholder Services Germany (formerly oekom research) and has been consistently updated for more than 25 years. ESG Corporate Rating - The ESG Corporate Rating universe, which is currently expanding from more than 8,000 corporate issuers to a targeted 10,000 issuers in 2020, covers important national and international indices as well as additional companies from sectors with direct links to sustainability and the most important bond issuers that are not publicly listed companies. The assessment of a company's social & governance and environmental performance is based on approximately 100 environmental, social and governance indicators per sector, selected from a pool of 800+ proprietary indicators. All indicators are evaluated independently based on clearly defined performance expectations and the results are aggregated, taking into account each indicator’s and each topic’s materiality-oriented weight, to yield an overall score (rating). If no relevant or up-to-date company information with regard to a certain indicator is available, and no assumptions can be made based on predefined standards and expertise, e.g. known and already classified country standards, the indicator is assessed with a D-. In order to obtain a comprehensive and balanced picture of each company, our analysts assess relevant information reported or directly provided by the company as well as information from reputable independent sources. In addition, our analysts actively seek a dialogue with the assessed companies during the rating process and companies are regularly given the opportunity to comment on the results and provide additional information. Analyst Opinion - Qualitative summary and explanation of the central rating results in three dimensions: (1) Opportunities - assessment of the quality and the current and future share of sales of a company’s products and services, which positively or negatively contribute to the management of principal sustainability challenges. (2) Risks - summary assessment of how proactively and successfully the company addresses specific sustainability challenges found in its business activity and value chain, thus reducing its individual risks, in particular regarding its sector’s key issues. (3) Governance - overview of the company’s governance structures and measures as well as of the quality and efficacy of policies regarding its ethical business conduct. Norm-Based Research - Severity Indicator - The assessment of companies' sustainability performance in the ESG Corporate Rating is informed by a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of companies' ability to prevent and mitigate ESG controversies. ISS ESG conducts research and analysis on corporate involvement in verified or alleged failures to respect recognized standards for responsible business conduct through Norm-Based Research . Norm-Based Research is based on authoritative standards for responsible business conduct such as the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights and the Sustainable Development Goals. As a stress-test of corporate disclosure, Norm-Based Research assesses the following: - Companies' ability to address grievances and remediate negative impacts - Degree of verification of allegations and claims - Severity of impact on people and the environment, and systematic or systemic nature of malpractices Severity of impact is categorized as Potential, Moderate, Severe, Very severe. This informs the ESG Corporate Rating. Decile Rank - The Decile Rank indicates in which decile (tenth part of total) the individual Corporate Rating ranks within its industry from 1 (best – company’s rating is in the first decile within its industry) to 10 (lowest – company’s rating is in the tenth decile within its industry). The Decile Rank is determined based on the underlying numerical score of the rating. If the total number of companies within an industry cannot be evenly divided by ten, the surplus company ratings are distributed from the top (1 decile) to the bottom. If there are Corporate Ratings with identical absolute scores that span a division in decile ranks, all ratings with an equal decile score are classified in the higher decile, resulting in a smaller number of Corporate Ratings in the decile below. Distribution of Ratings - Overview of the distribution of the ratings of all companies from the respective industry that are included in the ESG Corporate Rating universe (company portrayed in this report: dark blue). ESG Corporate Rating / Last Modification: 2020-06-18 Page 7 © ISS ESG,Raiffeisen Bank International AG Methodology - Overview Industry Leaders - List (in alphabetical order) of the top three companies in an industry from the ESG Corporate Rating universe at the time of generation of this report. Key Issue Performance - Overview of the company's performance with regard to the key social and environmental issues in the industry, compared to the industry average. Performance Score - The ESG Performance Score allows for cross-industry comparisons using a standardized best-in-class threshold that is valid across all industries. It is the numerical representation of the alphabetic ratings (D- to A+) on a scale of 0 to 100 with 50 representing the prime threshold. All companies with values greater than 50 are Prime, while companies with values less than 50 are Not Prime. As a result, intervals are of varying size depending on the original industry-specific prime thresholds. Rating History - Development of the company's rating over time and comparison to the average rating in the industry. Rating Scale - Companies are rated on a twelve-point scale from A+ to D-: A+: the company shows excellent performance. D-: the company shows poor performance (or fails to demonstrate any commitment to appropriately address the topic). Overview of the range of scores achieved in the industry (light blue) and indication of the grade of the company evaluated in this report (dark blue). Sources of Information - A selection of sources used for this report is illustrated in the annex. Status & Prime Threshold - Companies are categorized as Prime if they achieve/exceed the sustainability performance requirements (Prime threshold) defined by ISS ESG for a specific industry (absolute best-in-class approach) in the ESG Corporate Rating. Prime companies are sustainability leaders in their industry and are better positioned to cope with material ESG challenges and risks, as well as to seize opportunities, than their Not Prime peers. The financial materiality of the Prime Status has been confirmed by performance studies, showing a continuous outperformance of the Prime portfolio when compared to conventional indices over more than 14 years. Transparency Level - The Transparency Level indicates the company’s materiality-adjusted disclosure level regarding the environmental and social performance indicators defined in the ESG Corporate Rating. It takes into consideration whether the company has disclosed relevant information regarding a specific indicator, either in its public ESG disclosures or as part of the rating feedback process, as well as the indicator’s materiality reflected in its absolute weight in the rating. The calculated percentage is classified in five transparency levels following the scale below. 0% - < 20%: very low 20% - < 40%: low 40% - < 60%: medium 60% - < 80%: high 80% - 100%: very high For example, if a company discloses information for indicators with a cumulated absolute weight in the rating of 23 percent, then its Transparency Level is “low”. A company’s failure to disclose, or lack of transparency, will impact a company’s ESG performance rating negatively. Industry Classification - The social and environmental impacts of industries differ. Therefore, based on its relevance, each industry analyzed is classified in a Sustainability Matrix. Depending on this classification, the two dimensions of the ESG Corporate Rating, the Social Rating and the Environmental Rating, are weighted and the sector-specific minimum requirements for the ISS ESG Prime Status (Prime threshold) are defined (absolute best-in-class approach).
