(“ OMA ”, or the “Company”) operates and manages 13 international airports in central and northern Mexico. The Company employs approximately 1,00 0 people , and it s airports served over 11.1 million passengers in 2020 and 23.2 million passengers in 20 19 . In addition, the Company’s business includes the management of hotels and industrial parks. OMA has develope d the OMA Green Bond Framework (the “ F ramework ”) under which it intends to issue green bonds and use the proceeds to finance and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and/ or future projects tha t are expected to reduce the environmental footprint of OMA’s operations . The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in four areas: 1. Renewable Energy 2. Energy Efficiency 3. Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management 4. Biodiversity OMA engaged Sustainalytics to review the OMA Green Bond Framework , dated March 2021 , and to provide a S econd - P arty O pinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) . 1 Th is F ramework has been published in a separate document . 2 Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ’ Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent 3 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework wi th the current market standards and the extent to which t he eligible project categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • T he Framework’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, a s administered by ICMA ; • The credibility and anticipated p ositive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and • The alignment of the issuer ’ s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its intern al taxonomy, versio n 1.7, which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various me mbers of OMA ’s management team to understand the sustaina bility impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. OMA representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of OMA to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclos ed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relev ant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. Any update of the present Secon d - Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and OMA . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market standards, i s no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds bu t does not measure the actual i mpact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - prin ciples - gbp/ . 2 The OMA Green Bond Framework is available on OMA ’s website at: https: //ir.oma.aero/index.php/es/debt - profile . 3 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustainalytics and ensuring analyst independence is paramount to producing objective, action able research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust conflict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consistency of process, structural separation of commercial and res earch (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparency.,Second - Party Opinion OMA Green Bond Framework 3 In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the potential allocation of proceeds but does not guara ntee the reali z ed allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or argument , either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that OMA has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second - Party Opinion . Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustai nalytics’ Opinion on the OMA Green Bond Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the OMA Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns to the four core components of the GBP . Sustainalytics highl ights the following elements of OMA ’s G re e n B ond F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible categor ies — Renewable Energy , Energy Efficiency , Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management , and Biodiversity — are aligned with those recognized by the GBP. Sustainalytics notes that the eligible project s are expected to reduce the environmental footprint of OMA’s operations. - Under the “ Renewable Energy ” category, OMA intends to finance the construction of renewable energy projects and battery storage . OMA has communicated to Sustainalytics that most inv estments under this category will be towards solar power projects that primarily include costs related to solar panels and inverter systems . - Within the “ Ene rgy Efficiency ” category, OMA may finance energy - efficient systems such as heating, ventilation , air conditioning and control systems that monitor and optimize electricity usage , including smart meters, load control systems , and building information systems. OMA has confirmed to Sustainalytics that these are electric and non - motorized equipment . Sustaina lytics encourages OMA to report on estimated or achieved energy efficiency, on a portfolio basis, where feasible. - For the “ Sustainable Water and Waste water Management“ category , OMA intends to invest in technologies and projects that improve water quality or water efficiency through the collection, distribution, treatment, recycling or reuse of water, rainwater and wastewater from its operations . - Under the “ Biodiversity ” category, OMA expects to finance projects that are aimed at supporting the preservati on of local flora and fauna located near OMA’s airport facilities . These activities include the realization of conservation studies and their implementations to protect vegetation such as wetlands and mangroves. - Sustainalytics notes that the cat egories hig hlighted above intend to have a positive environmental impact and hence, considers investments in these categories to be aligned with market practice. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - OMA’s internal process for project evaluation and selection will be ov erseen by the Green Bond Working Group (“GBWG”) . The GBWG is chaired by the CEO and comprises representatives from the Finance, Infrastructure and Maintenance, and Airport Operations departments. - The GBWG will meet semi - annually to review and select eligi ble green projects in line with the Framework’s eligibility criteria and subject to complianc e with OMA’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. - Based o n the establishment of a formal working group , Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - The net proceeds of the bond will be earmarked for a llocation to eligible green projects . OMA’s Finance department will oversee this process along with the allocation of proceeds .,Second - Party Opinion OMA Green Bond Framework 4 - U nallocated proceeds will be held in line with OMA’s general liquidity guidelines. OMA intends to reach full allocation within 36 months of the issuance. - Based o n these elements , Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Reporting: - OMA intends to report on the allocation of proceeds on its website on an annual basis until full allocation. Allocation reporting will include (i) the amount of proceeds allocated to eligible green projects, (ii) the breakdown of allocation by eligible category, (iii) the geograph ic location, (iv) the share of financing vs refinancing, and (v) the balance of unallocated proceeds. - In addition, OMA is committed to reporting on relevant impact metrics, where feasible , including annual renewable energy generation ( MWh/GWh ) , annual emi ssions reduced/avoided ( tonnes of CO 2 e) , change in a nnual absolute (gross) water use ( m 3 /a ) , change in a nnual absolute (gross) amount of wastewater treated, reused or avoided ( in m 3 /a ) , a registry of protected and/or relocated animals , and hectares of loca l vegetation preserved . - Based on commitments to both impact and allocation reporting, Sustainalytics conside rs this process to be in line with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that the OMA Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 1 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Fo rm. Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of OMA Contribution of F ramework to OMA ’s sustainability strategy OMA has a sustainability strategy that is guided on the respect for human rights, the mitigation of the environmental impact of its operations , the quality of working life and the balanced use of economic, social and environmental resources. OMA h as in place a Sustainability Policy 4 that has taken into consideration a material ity assessment performed by the Company in 2014. 5 The materiality assessment identified environmental aspects such as greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water consumption , a nd biodiversity loss as priority areas to address. Furthermore, OMA has developed five commitments under its S ustainability P olicy , among which Sustainalytics highlights the following two for being particularly aligned with the objectives of the Framework: • The e nvironment – OMA ’s environmental commitment s eeks t o favor the preservation of the environment; the promotion of environmental ly - friendly practices ; the establishment of targets to prevent pollution; the reuse, recovery and recycling of material s ; an d the mitigation of environmental impacts regarding water, air, land, biodiversity , noise, waste and energy. • Biodiversity – OMA’s biodiversity commitment intends to mitigate the impacts from its operations by teach ing employees about the impacts and benef its of the protection and conserv ation of biodiversity at its facilities; the identification of flora and fauna and establishment of conservation priorities; and collaborat ing with external organizations and government bodies for the protection and recover y of ecological spaces within and near its facilities. OMA’s Action Plan for the Protection of Biodiversity , in place since 2014, guides the development of programs, investments and activities that focus on the protection and conservation of biodiverse - ri ch areas that fall within its airports and in communities or municipalities where OMA operates. Furthermore , OMA has communicated to Sustainalytics that in 2017 it signed a purchase power agreement (the “PPA”) to obtain electricity from ren e wable sources commencing in March 2019 . From March to December 31, 2019, OMA consumed approximately 34.6 GWh of wind energy under the PPA, representing a bout 66% of the total electricity consumption of OMA over that period. In 2020, due to the reduction in electricity consumptio n as a result of reduced activity in OMA’s airports and measures implemented to reduce costs and expenses, OMA consumed a total of 40.7 GWh of electricity, of which 78% (31.7 GWh) was supplied through the PPA . In consideration of the overall carbon intensity of aviation as a mode of transport , Sustainalytics notes OMA’s financing has the potential to contribute to the decarbonization of the associated infrastructure , which also 4 OM A, “Sustainability Policy”, at: https://www.oma.ae ro/en/oma - group/sustainability/sustainability - policy.htm . 5 OMA, “Sustainability Report 2017”, at : https://ir.oma.aero/static - files/5d533580 - eea7 - 46c0 - 8837 - 0a23a232122d .,Second - Party Opinion OMA Green Bond Framework 5 contributes to the economic developme nt of Mexico (refer to section 3 for Sustainalytics ’ assessment of t he environmental impact ). Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the OMA Green Bond Framework is aligned with the company’s overall sustainability strategy and initiatives and will further the Company’s action on its key environmental priorities. Sustainaly tics recognizes the importance of the above - mentioned commitments by OMA as important contributors to the company’s sustainability performance and encourages the Company to define time - bound and quantifiable sustainability targets. Well - positioned to addre ss common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the net proceeds from the bonds issued under the Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are recognized by the GBP to have positiv e environmental impact, Sustainalytics is aware that such eligible projects could also lead to negative environmental and social outcomes . Some key environmental and social risks associated with the eligible projects could include occupational health and s afety, community relations, land - use change , and emissions, effluents, and waste generated in construction . Sustainalytics is of the opinion that OMA is able to manage and/or mitigate potential risks through implementation of the following: • OMA ’s manageme nt and employees are bound by the “ B usiness Ethics and Cond uc t Code” 6 which estab lish es work principles and includes safeguards for worker health and safety and the environment. • Ten out of 13 airports operated by OMA have maintained the certification as S afe Companies b y the Mexican Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare ( Spanish: Secretaria de Trabajo y Previsión Social) . OMA expects to obtain the certification for the remaining three airports in 2021. • As of 2019 all airports, excluding Monterrey, held th e Environmental Quality Certificate ( Spanish : Certificado de Calidad Ambiental) issued by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Environment ( Spanish: Procuraduría Federal de Protección al Ambiente) – a voluntary verification of conformance with appl icable rules an d regulations regarding environmental protection . 7 OMA expects to obtain this certification for the Monterrey airport in 2021. • In regard to community relations, OMA performs annual “Consultive Commissions” with members from public authoriti es, representatives of chambers of commerce, the private sector and civil society. • OMA’s Sustainability Policy encourages the reuse, recovery and recyclin g of material and includes environmental protection and mitigation strategies from OMA’s operations e ncompassing water, air , land, noise and waste . 8 In addition, OMA has established a risk assessment system to identify risks pertaining to the environment , corruption, labor rights, labor conditions, and quality of service from its critical suppliers . The Company requires its suppliers to adhere to the Code of Ethics and Conduct Rules for Suppliers, Subcontractors and Business Partners. 9 Based on these pol icies, standards and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that OMA has implemented adequate me asures and is well - positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible categories. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All four use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP. Sus tainalytics has focused below on where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context. Importance of energy efficiency and renewable en ergy in Mexico The aviation sector accounts for 2% of human - induced CO 2 emissions , and even though the airport industry only accounts for 5% of the sector ' s emissions, airports are a vital part of the entire transportation network . 10 , 11 Airport emissions derive predominantly from gasoline or diesel - fueled vehicles , ground support equipment, fossil - powered electricity , heating, and cooling. 12 Energy efficiency measures have the potential to mitigate 6 OMA, “Business Ethics and C onduct Code”, at: https://ir.oma.aero/sta tic - files/8955a21b - a3f5 - 41e5 - 969d - 9778f94c528c . 7 OMA, “Form 20F: Annual Report” (2020) https://ir.oma.aero/static - files/3d4e5f24 - cb0a - 4030 - 92b7 - a7 d54538fff1 8 OM A, “Su stainability Report 2017”, at : https://ir.oma.aero/static - files/5d533580 - eea7 - 46c0 - 8837 - 0a23a232122d . 9 Ibid . 10 Airport Carbon Accreditation, “ Airpo rts addressing their C O2 emissions ”, at: https://airportco2.org/ 11 Airport Transport Action Group, at: https://www.atag.org/facts - figures.html 12 ICAO, “Eco Airport Toolkit”, at: https://www.icao.int/environmental - protection/Documents/Energy%20at%20Airports.pdf,Second - Party Opinion OMA Green Bond Framework 6 an airport’s carbon footprint and will b e a key component of achieving the decarbonization goals of the sector. Furthermore, i nvestments in renewable energy projects provide additional and significant benefits for individual airports and br ing broa der environmental benefits that go beyond the ai rport itself , including the reduction of GHG emissions from the electricity grid. According to a report from the International Renew able Energy Agency ( " IRENA " ), Mexico has the potential to generate 46% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. 13 Renewable energy generation in Mexico could have significant positive environmental impacts and potential for fostering social and e conomic development due to the country ' s diverse renewable energy source base. 14 Give n the importance of the renewable ene rgy sector in Mexico ' s socio - economic development and potential impact in reducing the country ' s GHG emissions, the Mexican Government has set the target to generate at least 35% of power from clean energy sources by 2024 and at least 50% by 2050. 15 Despit e the se ambitious targets set by the government, fossil fuels still make up approximately 87% of Mexico ' s energy mix. 16 While there has b een an increase in renewable energy generation capacity , the energy mix's carbon intensity has remained almost unchanged s inc e 2011, as this has been offset by the ri se in fossil - based energy sources used to meet growing energy demand s . 17 Th e stagnation of the energy mix’s carbon intensity highlights the need for fu rther investments in clean energy . Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the investments in renewable energy generation and energy efficiency projects made by OMA will be impactful and have the p otential to reduce its environmental footprint while supporting the clean energy targets set by . Alignment with/ contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and form an agen da for achieving sustai nable development by the year 2030. The bond(s) issued under the OMA Green Bond Framework advance the following SDGs and targets : Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Renewable Energy 7. Affordable and clean energy 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix Energy Efficiency 7.

Sustainalytics considers that the projects funded by the g reen bond pro ceeds are expected to provide positive environmental impact. The OMA Green Bond Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for the reporting on the allocation and imp act of the us e of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the OMA Green Bond Framework is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use of proceeds categories will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 6, 7 and 15 . Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that OMA has adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of pr oceeds. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that OMA is well - positioned to issue green bonds and that the OMA Green Bond Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018.,Second - Party Opinion OMA Green Bond Framework 8 Append ix Append ix 1 : Green B ond / Green Bond Programme - External Review Form Section 1.

Second - Party Opinion: A n institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second - Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information b arriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second - Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer ' s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of proje cts intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with inte rnal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the envir onmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer ' s intern al tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recogni z ed external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may v erify consistency with the certification criteria.,Second - Party Opinion OMA Green Bond Framework 13 iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issu er can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as speciali z ed research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating met hodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scena rio.
