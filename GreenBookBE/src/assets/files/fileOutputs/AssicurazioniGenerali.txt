Founded in 1833, Generali now operates in over 60 countries with approximately 71,000 employees, and is one of the world’s largest insurance providers by reve nue. Generali has developed the Assicurazioni Generali Green Bond Framework (the “ F ramework ”) under which it intends to issue green bonds and use the proceeds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, p rojects that advance the Group’s sustainability strategy and contribute to the financial sector’s transition to a low - carbon economy . The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in six areas: 1. Green Buildings 2. Renewable Energy E lectricity and Hea t Production 3. Energy Efficiency 4. Clean Transpor tation 5. Sustainable Water Management 6. Recycling, re - use & waste management Generali has engaged Sustainalytics to review the Assicurazioni Generali Green Bond Framework , dated May, 2019, and provide a second - party opinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) . 1 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 2 As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Generali ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Group ’s green bond. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Assicurazioni Generali Green Bond Framework and should be read in conjunction with th at F ramework. 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - socia l - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ 2 The Assicurazioni Generali Green Bond Framework is available on Generali’s website at: https://www.generali.com/investors/debt - ratings/green - bond - framework,Second - Party Opinion G enerali G reen Bond 3 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Assicurazioni Generali Green Bond Framework Summary Sustainalytic s is of the opinion that the Assicurazioni Generali Green Bond is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (the “GBP”) . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Generali’s F ramework : • Use of Pr oceeds: - The use of p roceeds categories – green buildings , renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean transportation, sustainable water management, and recycling, re - use & waste management – are recognized as impactful by the GBP. - Eligible assets are those for which the disbursement occurred no more than two years before the issuance of the green bond. Sustainalytics considers this to be in line with market norms. - The Framework defines exclusionary criteria that make activities related to fossil fuel energy , nuclear energy, large hydro (>20MW), gambling, tobac co, alcohol, and weapons in eligible for green bond financing. Sustainalytics views positively these exclusions, and considers them to strengthen Generali’s Framework. - G enerali has based its green buildings criteria on reputable third - party standards, and h as selected minimum levels of certification which Sustainalytics considers to be aligned with market practice. (See Appendix 1 for a summary of included certifications). Furthermore, building retrofits are included only when a minimum 30% energy savings ha s been achieved; Sustainalytics views this threshold to be in line with market practice. - The renewable energy category includes both technologies that are broadly recognized to have net - positive environmental impact, such as so lar and on - and off - shore win d, as well as other generation types which can, when developed responsibly, provide environmental benefits. ▪ G eothermal facilities are limited to those that have direct emissions of ≤ 100g CO 2 e/kWh , in line with market practice. 3 ▪ Eligible hydroelectric asset s i nclude facilities up to <20MW capacity which have either a power density of >5W/ m 2 or a carbon intensity of ≤ 100g CO2e/kWh . These smaller projects are largely recognized to have net - positive environmental impacts, and Sustainalytics views positively the additional qualifiers regarding power density and/or carbon intensity. - Eligible clean t ransportation projects include projects types clearly recognized to have positive impacts: mass transportation train/metro networks and infrastructure, and electric vehicles and supporting charging stations. Sustainalytics considers that these two categories will deliver positive environmental impacts. ▪ Generali has con firmed that mass transportation systems using fossil fuels are not eligible, which Sustainalytics views as strengthening the credibility of the Framework. - Generali’s green investments may include those related to sustainable water management, Sustainalytic s notes the following with regards to these eligible projects : ▪ The provision of drinking water, unless accompanied by improvements in efficiency or reduced resource loss, is viewed as having primarily social, not environmental benefits . Generali has clarif ied that its intention is to invest in projects which will provide water savings by reducing losses in transportation and distribution. ▪ Wetland preservation, drainage systems, and other flood management infrastructure can have positive environmental impa cts and improve climate resiliency; however, such projects also have risks related to impacts on natural habitats. Sustainalytics encourages Generali to specify the environmental assessments that are required in order to determine that undue negative impac ts are mitigated , and notes that the 3 This threshold is recognized by the Climate Bonds Initiative as aligned with a 2 - degree global warming scenario. https://www.climatebonds.net/standard/geothermal .,Second - Party Opinion G enerali G reen Bond 4 Company intends to provide this information within its reporting, subject to confidentiality concerns . - The Framework specifies that waste - to - energy projects with a conversion efficiency of 25% or greater and an emission s intensity of ≤ 100g CO 2 e/kWh for electricity generation and of <18.8 gCO 2 e/MJ for heat generation are eligible. 4 Sustainalytics notes positively that the efficiency rate compares positively to the range of existing incineration facilities, and that these emissions thresholds are compliant with a low - carbon trajectory . • Project Evaluation and Selection: - Generali has established a Green Bond Committe e to approve, review and monitor eligible green assets. This Committee will be led by the Head of Group Debt and Treasury, and will consist of representatives from various relevant departments including Corporate Sustainability and Social Responsibility , G roup Investment Governance , and Group Integrated Reporting that ensure selected assets comply with the Framework, as well as Generali’s relevant internal ESG policie s. - A three - step process has been defined in which assets are identified within various busi ness units, confirmed by the Committee, and then subject to ongoing review. - Based on the establishment of an inter - departmental committee and the commitment to ongoing review, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - Generali will allocate an amount equivalent to the net proceeds of its green bonds to eligible assets; on a best efforts basis it will achieve full allocation within one year of issuance. The Group will use its existing i nternal accounting systems to track and monitor disbursements. - Pending full allocation, proceeds may be temporarily invested in accordance with Generali’s investment guidelines in cash deposits, money market instruments, and SRI investments. - Based on the d isclosure of monitoring processes and intended temporary investments, Sustainalytics considers this to be in line with market practice. • Reporting: - Generali will provide annual allocation reporting, including the amount of proceeds allocated to each eligibl e category , the share of financing versus refinancing, and the amount allocated to various geographical regions. - Generali will also provide, on a best - efforts basis annual impact reporting, at the portfolio level. Where feasible, this will include relevant quantitative key performance indicators, as defined in the Framework. - Based on the commitment to annual allocation reporting and the intention to disclose impact K PIs when possible, Sustainalytics considers this to be in line with market practice . Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that Generali ’s g reen b ond aligns to the four c ore components of the Green Bond Principles 201 8 . F or detailed information please refer to Appendix 2 : Green B ond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form . S ection 2: Sustainability Performance of the Issuer Contribution of framework to issuer’s sustainab ility strategy Generali Group’s sustainability vision is that of creating a healthy, resilient and sustainable society by running a sustainable business and playing an active role in the communities in which it operates. 5 Sustainability at the Group is being managed by the Governance and Sustainability Committee, which is headed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors. 6 4 Conventional incineration technology generally has conversion efficiencies in the range of 15 - 27%; Generali’s 25% threshold is near the top - end of this spectrum. The emissions intensities for heat and power generation are in line with those of the Climate Bonds Initiative’s draft Bioenergy Criteria, which Sustainalytics considers to be representative of best practice. 5 Generali Group, “Charter of Sustainability Commitments”, at: https://www.generali.com/our - responsibilities/responsible - business/charter_sustainability_commitments - . 6 Generali Group, “Annual Integrat ed Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018”, at: https://www.generali.com/investors/reports - and - presentations .,Second - Party Opinion G enerali G reen Bond 5 Within its Responsible Investment Guideline, 7 the Generali Group commits to incorporating ESG issues into its investment analysis and decision - making processes, to incorporate ESG issues into the company’s ownership policies and practices and to seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entiti es in which the company invests. The company’s environmental policy reinforces its commitment to promoting environmental responsibility, through the reduction of its own business environmental impacts and integration of environmental and climate elements i n investment strategies. 8 Moreover, Generali Real Estate, a subsidiary of the Group, has policies from green buildings and green leases , which aim to improve the environmental performance of the company’s real estate assets, and have r esulted in an increas ed number of certified green buildings. 9 In terms of quantitative targets, 10 the Group has committed to increasing its investment s in green sectors by EUR 3.5 billion by 2020, allocating EUR 4.5 billion for green and sustainable investments by the end of 2 021, increasing revenue from social and green products by 7 - 9% by 2021, and progressing towards divestment from the coal sector by disposing of bond and equity investments while limiting any new business relationships . With regards to internal operations, the company also strives to reduce its GHG emissions by 20% until 2020 (compared to a 2013 baseline). 11 As part of its progress reports, Generali disclosed that in 2018 88% of its total energy purchases were renewable. 12 Furthermore, EUR 33.2 billion of the company’s assets are being managed in accordance with ESG principles, while direct investment in equities and bonds in line with its Responsible Investment Guidelines reached EUR 298 billion. 13 In addition to these operational outcomes , the sale of environm entally friendly policies made up EUR 1,769.2 million of the Group’s revenue in 2018. 14 Additionally, the Generali Group is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and the Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI), which contain strong principles regardin g environmental protection and responsible lending , 15 and worked on green finance together with international institutions and organizations, such as UNEP FI for Sustainable Insurance on the implementation of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate - related Financia l Disclosures) Recommendations by insurers. 16 Given the Group’s sustainability strategy, commitments, targets and progress reporting, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Generali is well positioned to issue green bonds and that its green bonds will adva nce its commitment to the provision of sustainable insurance and financial services . Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While the use of proceeds from Generali’s green bonds will be directed towards investments that are anticipated to have positive environmental impact, Sustainalytics recognizes that such projects may face risks related to negative environmental and social outcomes. In particular, any large infrastructure or construct ion project may be exposed to specific risks related to workers’ health and safety, biodiversity impacts, effects on local communities , and air, water and soil pollution. Generali Group has procedures in place intended to mitigate the risks associated wit h the projects in which it is involved, including: 7 Generali Group, “Responsible Investment Guideline”, at: https://www.generali.com/our - responsibilities/responsible - investments . 8 Generali Group, “Group Policy for the Environment and Climate”, at: https://www.generali.com/info/download - center/policies . 9 Generali Group, “Real Estate Investments”, at: https://www.generali.com/our - responsibilities/our - commitment - to - the - environment - and - climate/real - estate - investments . 10 Generali Group, “Commitment to the Climate”, at: https://www.generali.com/our - responsibilities/responsible - investments/commitment - to - the - climate .

As part of these guidelines, the company conducts analyses on the ESG policies, performance, practices and impacts in order to exclude or avoid enterprises with poor ESG practices, while also assessing and monitoring the investments that are exposed to ESG risks. 18 Moreover, the company considers high risk investments in companies that engage in ESG issues, such as: are involved in serious or systematic human rights violations and environmental damages. 19 Sustainalytics views these assessments and evaluations to support risk management related to investments made under the Framework. • Generali Group’s Policy for the Environment and Climate , which commit the company to protecting and conserving biodiversity and preventing pollution. 20 • An ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System has been implemented across most of t he Group ’s companies at over 350 local offices, covering 42% of employees and 87.5% of total gross direct premiums. 21 • A Code of Conduct, 22 which also covers third parties working with the company, ensures a healthy, safe and secure workplace and improvement of the circumstances of the communities in which it operates. • A s takeholder engagement approach , which define how Generali will engage in dialogue with relevant representatives from the communities in which business operations are conducted . 23 Given the above, Sustainalytics considers that the Generali Group is well positioned to mitigat e the potential environmental and social risks resul ting from the use of proceeds. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All s ix use of proceeds categories are recognized as impactful by the GBP. Sustainalytics has focused below on how the impact is specifically relevant in the local context. The Framework’s contribution to climate action In order to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change, the EU is pursuing the goal s of the Paris Climate Agreement and strives to reduce GHG emissions across its member states. The EU’s climate change goals for 2020 are to reduce GHG emissions by 20% (compared to 1990 levels), with a target of 40% by 2030 . 24 Moreover, over the long - term, the EU plans on cutting its emissions almost complete ly (80 - 95%) compared to 1990 levels. The eligible categories of Generali’s green bond , specifically those in the areas of renewable energy, clean transportation green buildings, and energy efficiency have the potential to contribute to the advancement of t hese climate objectives. T he EU has committed to meeting 20% of its total energy needs with renewables by 2020 and 32% by 2030 , 25 while the Italian government has committed to achieving a 35% renewable energy target 26 and an installed solar capacity of 50 GW over the same time period . 27 Renewable energy currently represent s 17.5% of the total energy consumption in the EU, having increasing by two thirds in the period of 2007 - 2017 , 28 and makes up 30.7% of the EU gross ele ctricity consumption. 29 On a more global scale, renewable energy production within the OECD increased by over 68% over the period 2000 - 2017. 30 Nevertheless, the International Renewable Energy Agency predicts that in order to meet a 2 - degree warming target re newable energy 17 Generali Group, “Responsible Investment Guideline”, at: https://www.generali.com/our - respons ibilities/responsible - investments . 18 Generali Group, “Responsible Investments”, at: https://www.generali.com/our - responsibilities/responsible - investments . 19 Generali Grou p, “Responsible Investment Guideline”, at: https://www.generali.com/our - responsibilities/responsible - investments . 20 Generali Group, “Group Policy for the Environment and Climate”, at: https://www.generali.com/info/download - center/policies . 21 Generali Group, “Environmental Management System”, at: https://www.generali.com/our - responsibilities/our - commitment - to - the - environment - and - climate/environmental - management . 22 Generali Group, “Generali Group Code of Conduct”, at: https://www.generali.com/info/download - center/policies. . 23 Generali Group, “Stakeholder Engagement”, at: https://www.generali.com/our - responsibilities/responsible - business/stakeholder - engagement . 24 European Commission, “EU climate action”, at: https://ec.europa.eu/clima/citizens/eu_en . 25 European Commission, “EU climate action”, at: https://ec.europa.eu/clima/citizens/eu_en . 26 Lawyers Italy, “Italy has a 35% Renewable Energy Target by 20 30”, (2018), at: https://www.lawyersitaly.eu/blog/italy - has - a - 35 - renewable - energy - target - by - 2030 . 27 Bellini E., (2019), PV Magazine, “Italy sets 2030 solar tar get of 50 GW”, at: https://www.pv - magazine.com/2019/01/11/italy - sets - 2030 - solar - target - of - 50 - gw/ . 28 Eurostat, “Renewable energy statistics”, (2019), at: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics - explained/index.php/Renewable_energy_statistics . 29 Eurostat, “Renewable energy statistics”, (2019), at: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics - explained/index.php/Renewable_energy_statistics . 30 OECD Data, “Renewable energy”, at: https://data.oecd.org/energy/renewable - energy.htm,Second - Party Opinion G enerali G reen Bond 7 deplo y ment must expand to meet approximately two thirds of global primary energy demand. 31 In this context, there is a clear need for the continued expansion of clean generation technologies, and Sustainalytics views positively Generali’s potential investments in wind, solar, small hydro, and geothermal energy facilities. Regarding the transport sector, the EU plans to drastically reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and cut CO 2 emissions by 60 % by 2050 (baseline year 1990) , 32 as the transport sector contributed 27% of the total EU GHG emissions in 2016 . 33 Generali’s projects in th is area will primarily focus on two areas of transportation: the development of mass transit projects, in particular t rain and metro systems, and the promotion of electric vehicles and the required supporting charging infrastructure. Finally, improve d performance in energy efficiency , especially within the buildings sector, which accounts for around 40% of the total ene rgy consumption and 36% of CO 2 emissions in the EU , will be necessary to support worldwide progress towards decarbonisation 34 Over the period 2005 to 2016, final energy consumption in the EU has decreased by only 7%, a rate which jeopardizes its ability to reach its energy efficiency target , 35 and highlighting the need for continued public and private investments in this area . 36 This conclusion holds true on a worldwide scale, with a recent report from the International Energy Agency concluding that progress with regards to efficiency has slowed in recent years, contributing to an increased in global energy demand; the IEA further states that a weakening of policy supports has contributed to these developments. 37 Sustainalytics views the investments in energy e fficiency and green buildings, as contemplated by the Framework, as making a positive contribution towards energy efficiency and climate goals . The importance of investments in waste management Across the OECD, 524.4 kg per capita of municipal solid was te w as generated in 2017, a trend that has largely been flat over time. 38 The World Bank states that in both high - income and upper - middle - income countries, landfilling is the most common disposal method. 39 In an effort to address this issue, a ccording to European Commission regulations , the share of recycled municipal waste must increase to 55% by 2025, 60% by 2030 and 65% by 2035. 40 Moreover, the EU has also mandated that landfilled waste b e 10% or less of total municipal waste generation by 20 35, together with mandatory separate collection of bio - waste and stricter policies to require producers of waste to pay for the collection of key recyclables. 41 As a result, in 2016, the landfilling of households’ waste was reduced to 24% in the EU, while t he rate of recycling reached 46%. 42 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Generali Group’s investments into facilities for collection, sorting and material recovery, recycling and reuse of material and production of biogas from organic waste, and waste to e nergy plants will be environmentally beneficial , supporting waste management goals and transition the transition to a circular economy. The importance of sustainable water management In terms of water management, the Framework proposes a broad range of po tential investments including domestic water distribution, irrigation technology, water treatment and recycling, and storm water management. Sustainalytics considers that these projects, when well - selected and developed, will deliver positive environmental impacts. Sustainalytics views positively Generali’s intention to invest in the various 31 IRENA, “Perspectives for the Energy Transition”, http://www.irena.org//media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2017/Mar/Perspectives_for_the_Energy_Transition_2017.pdf?la=en&has h=56436956B 74DBD22A9C6309ED76E3924A879D0C7 32 European Commission, “Clean Transport Systems”, at: https://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/urban/cts_en . 33 European Environmental Agency, “Gree nhouse gas emissions from transport”, (2018), at: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data - and - maps/indicators/transport - emissions - of - greenhouse - gases/transport - emissions - of - greenhouse - gases - 11 . 34 European Commission, “Energy performance of buildings”, at: https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy - efficiency/energy - performance - of - buildings . 35 European Environmental Agency, “Energy efficiency”, at: https://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2018/resource - efficiency - and - low - carbon - economy/energy - efficiency . 36 European Policy Centre, “The EU will not meet its climate goals unless it makes smarter use of its finan cial resources”, (2018), at: http://www.epc.eu/pub_details.php?cat_id=4&pub_id=8807 . 37 IEA, “Energy Efficiency 2018”, https://www.iea.org/efficiency2018/ 38 OECD Data, “Municipal Waste” , https://data.oecd.org/waste/municipal - waste.htm 39 World Bank, “What a waste 2.0”, https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/30317/211329ov.pdf?sequence=11&isAllowed=y 40 Financial Observer, “Circular economy – the European Commission’s i dea for the waste management”, (2018), at: https://financialobserver.eu/poland/circular - economy - the - european - commissions - idea - for - t he - waste - management/ . 41 European Environmental Bureau, “Waste no more: Introducing Europe’s new waste laws”, (2018), at: https://eeb.org/waste - no - more - introducing - europes - ne w - waste - laws/ . 42 Financial Observer, “Circular economy – the European Commission’s idea for the waste management”, (2018), at: htt ps://financialobserver.eu/poland/circular - economy - the - european - commissions - idea - for - the - waste - management/ .,Second - Party Opinion G enerali G reen Bond 8 interrelated segments of the sustainable water management industry, and considers the intended outcomes of water savings, improved water quality, and climate resiliency to be environmentally beneficial. W hile noting that the impacts of water management approaches are highly regionally - specific, Sustainalytics has considered Generali’s home market of Italy as representative of the benefit that the financed proj ects may deliver. In particular, it is noted that agriculture is the predominant water use r in Italy, consuming as much as two thirds of available water resources. 43 Furthermore, Italy’s National Climate Change Adaptation Plan 44 highlights that Italy, along with the broader southern European and Mediterranean areas, will be particularly susceptible to the impact of climate changes, in the form of increased droughts and severe rainfall events, further reinforcing the need for improved water management approach es. In this context, Sustainalytics anticipates that projects the support the ability to manage rainfall, treat water and wastewater, and efficiently treat and distribute water, will provide overall positive impacts. Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030.

LEED was developed by the non - profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and covers the design, construction, mainten ance and operation of buildings. BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) was first published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in 1990. Based in the UK, BREEAM can be u sed for new, refurbished and extension of existing buildings. The Haute Qualité Environnementale or HQE (High Quality Environmental standard) is a standard for green building in France, based on the principles of sustainable development first set out at the 1992 Earth Summit. The sta ndard was launched in 2005 and is controlled by HQE and certificate is issued by Cerway/ Certivea/ Cerqual.

Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or app ropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, i t can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verif ication: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allo cation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds cer tified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification cri teria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, acco rding to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from cr edit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion G enerali G reen Bond 17 Disclaimer © Sustainalytics 201 9 .
