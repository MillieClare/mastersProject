The Company has an international presence in 36 countries and in 2019 had approximately 43GW of generation capacity . RWE has developed the RWE Green Bond Framework (the “ F ramework ”) under which it intends to issue multiple green bon ds and use the proceeds to finance and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and/ or future projects tha t will contribute to the expansion of renewable energy capacity, specifically solar energy as well as on - and off - shore wind farms. The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in one area: 1. Renewable Energy RWE engaged Sustainalytics to review the RWE Green Bond Framework , dated April 2020 , and provide a second - party opinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) . 1 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 2 Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent 3 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics’ assessed the following: • The Framework’s alignment with the ICMA Green Bond Principles 2018 • The credibility and antici pated positive impacts of the use of proceeds • The alignment of the issuer’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its inter nal taxonomy, versio n 1.3.1 , which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of RWE ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting asp ects of the Framework. RWE representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of RWE to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant inf ormation and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and shoul d be read in conjunction with that Framework. Any update of the present Second - Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and RWE . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the align ment of the Framework with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the intended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee the realized allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as b eing a statement, representation, warrant or argument either in favour or against the truthfulness, reliability 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - soci al - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ . 2 The RWE Green Bond Framework is available on RWE’s website at: https://www.group.rwe/en/investor - relations/bonds - and - rating/green - financing 3 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, object ive research is a cornerstone of Sustainalytics and ensuring analyst independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust con flict management framework that specifically addresses the nee d for analyst independence, consistency of process, structural separation of commercial and research (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial ou tcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparency.,Second - Party Opinion RWE Green Bond Framework 3 or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that RWE has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose o f this SPO.,Second - Party Opinion RWE Green Bond Framework 4 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the RWE Green Bond Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the RWE Green Bond Framework aligns with the four core components of the GBP 201 8 . Sustainalytics highlights th e following elements of RWE ’ s G reen B ond F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible category , Renewable Energy , is aligned with those recognized by the GBP 2018. - RWE may use proceeds for the conception, development, construction, installation and acquisition of renewable energy production units, specifically solar energy, onshore and offshore wind farms. In regards to solar energy, RWE has indicated to Sustainalytics that concentrated solar power (CSP)/solar thermal facilities are not currently in consideration to be financed, but may invest into these CSP/solar thermal facilities in the future. In the event that financing is provided for such facilities, Sustainalytics re commends that the Issuer reports on the use of fossil - fuel backup sources. Projects will primarily be in Europe a nd North America. Sustainalytics positively views investments into the expansion of renewable energy capacity. - RWE has set a look - back period o f three years. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - RWE has established a Green Bond Committee (the “Committee”), which is comprised of representatives fro m RWE’s Corporate Responsibility, Finance & Credit Risk, Investor Relations and Controlling departments . The Committee is responsible for all aspects of project evaluation and selection, including reviewing and approving eligible projects for the Eligible Project Portfolio, monitoring project eligibility and removing/replacing as needed - Based o n this, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - RWE’s Finance & Credit Risk De p artment will manage the allocation of proceeds. An amount equivalent to the net proceeds raised from the bond(s) will b e allocated to the Eligible Project Port folio based on the recommendation of the Committee . Proceeds will be tracked via RWE’s internal tracking and accounting systems. RWE will strive to maintain a level of allocation for the Eligible Project Portfolio th at matches or exceeds the balance of net proceeds from its outstanding green bonds. If any, unallocated proceeds will be temporarily held in RWE’s liquidity portfolio, invested in cash and/or cash equivalents, and re - allocated as soon as feasible. - Based on these elements, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Reporting: - On an annual basis, RWE is committed to reporting on allocation and, where feasible, impact of the portfolio at least at the Eligible Project cate gory level, starting one after issuance . Material developments such as, Framework modifications or allocation portfolio will be reported in a timely manner . Allocation reporting will include the total amount of investments and expe nditures allocated to the Eligible Project Portfolio , the portion of financing vs refinancing , and, if any, unallocated proceeds. In addition, RWE will strive to report on estimate d positive environmental impact from projects using indicators such as annua l energy generation (in kWh) of green funded investments ; and estimated annual CO 2 avoided (tCO 2 ) . In addition, RWE may provide qualitative descriptions of the outcomes and impacts of selected Eligible Projects. - Based o n the above, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that the RWE Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP 201 8 . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 1 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form.,Second - Party Opinion RWE Green Bond Framework 5 Section 2: Sustainability Performance of RWE / Sustainability Strategy of RWE Contribution of framework to RWE ’s sustainabilit y strategy RWE demonstrates a strong commitment to sustainability and represents a high level of transparency in its sustainability reporting . 4 The Company has d efined its sustainability purp ose as “Our energy for a sustainable life” and its transition towards clean, renewable energy is embedded in to t he business. I n 2019, RWE was able to reduce energy emissions compared to the previous year , making it the seventh consecutive year of reduced emissions. Since 2012, the Company has succ eeded in halving its CO 2 emissions, representing a saving of more than 90 million metric tons of CO 2 . As part of its commitment to sustainability , RWE has established the objective of becoming carbon neutral by 2040. 4 As one of the leading energy supplier s in Europe, this is a n ambitious goal that , if achieved, could contribute significantly to national climate reduction targets. As such, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the renewable energy projects and activities financed under this Framework will contribute to RWE’s sustainability strategy and its 2040 target to become carbon neutral. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While it is recognized that the net proceeds from the bonds issued under the Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are recognized by the GBP 2018 , Sustainalytics acknowledges that the development of renewable energy facilities and related infrastructure has associated environmental and social risks . Some key environmental and social risks associated could include land - use change , water use and wast e management as well as worker health and safety issues and community safety . Sustainalytics is of the opinion that RWE can manage and/or mitigate potential risks through its implementation of the following: • RWE has established an Environmental Managemen t System (EMS) that follows the ISO 14001 standard, which is viewed as a robust, credible international EMS standard . 5 As of 2019, the 89% of the Company’s EMS’ were externally certified and the Company maintains a goal to obtain 100% coverage of its’ EMS systems. 6 • The Company’s waste prevention and disposal policy follows the waste hierarchy and aims to prevent, reuse, recycle and eliminate waste to the greatest extent possible. Moreover, the Company strives to reduce its water use and ensure proper treatment of any effluents. 7 • RWE requires all employees to go through intensive training for accident - preventio n and to create awareness about general safe working conditions. The Company has als o implemented processes to ensure community safety an d regularly engages with local stakeholders to ensure readiness in the event of any safety risk . 8 Based on these policies, standards , and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that RWE has implemented adequate measures and is well positioned to ma nage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible categories. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds Renewable energy is a use of proceeds catego ry recognized by the GBP. Sustainalytics has provided commentary below to highlight the impact s of this category relevant to the local context. Increasing Renewable Energy Power Capacity & Generation in the EU Energy production and consumption are the largest source s of GHG emissions in the EU. 9 To reduce energy - related emissions and the reliance on fossil fuels , the EU has set a binding target to achieve a share of at least 32% of renewable energy by 2030 . 10 This would also help the EU in meeting its emission reduction targets ; the EU and its Member States are committed to a minimum 40% domestic reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, from 1990 levels . 10 F orecast studies have show n that to achiev e a 35% share of renewable energy sources in final consumption , total renewable electricity production should range between 60 - 65% , demonstrating the need for substantial expansion of renewable energy production . 11 In 2018, renewables 4 RWE, “Responsibility and sustainability”, (2020), at: https://www.group.rwe/en/responsibility - and - s ustainability 5 ISO, “14001 :2015”, (2015), at : https://www.iso.org/standard/60857.html 6 RWE, “Environmental protection”, (2020), at: https://www.group.rwe/en/responsibility - and - sustainability/environmental - protection 7 RWE, “Water use and waste management”, (2020), at: https://www.group.rwe/en/responsibility - and - sustainability/environmental - protection/water - use - and - waste - management 8 RWE, “Safety”, (2020), at: htt ps://www.group.rwe/en/responsibility - and - sustainability/social - affairs - and - society/safety 9 European Environment Agency, “Energy and non - energy related greenhouse gas emissions”, (2015), at: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data - and - maps/indicators/specification.2010 - 08 - 09.2026605593/assessment - 1 10 European Commission, “ 2030 climate & energy framework ” , at : https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en 11 IFRI, “More renewables in the European Union? Yes, we can”, (2018), at: https://www.ifri.org/en/publications/editoriaux - de - lifri/edito - energie/more - renewables - european - union - yes - we - can,Second - Party Opinion RWE Green Bond Framework 6 (including hydro) produced 28.2% of the electricity in the EU - 28, increasing its share by 2.5 % since 2016. 12 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the projects funded through the Framework could further help the EU in meeting its renew able energy and emission reduction targets by increasing renewable energy power capacity and generation. Increasing Renewable Energy Power Capacity & Generation in the US In the US, CO 2 emissions from the energy sector decreased by 16%, from 2007 to 2017. 13 P ower generation experienced the largest change , with a decrease of 27% below 2007 levels . 13 In addition, a recent decline in the global carbon intensity of the US economy is primarily due to lower carbon intensity in electricity generation. 13 The growth of renewable electricity generation contributed to reduce CO 2 from power generation on both a level and intensity basis. 13 In addition, t he share of renewable energy in the US increased from 9% in 2008 to 16% in 2018 , with wind and solar contributing the most. As such, RWE renewable energy projects such as solar a nd wind could further increase the share of renewable electricity in power generation and reduce electricity production carbon intensity. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that projects funded through the Framework are impactful in the EU and US context, contributing to reduce energy related CO 2 emissions by increasing renewable power generation and subsequently reducing the average carbon intensity of the electricity generated. Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Go als (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. This green bond advances the following SDG goal and target : Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Renewable Energy 7. Affordable and Clean Energy 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix Conclusion RWE has developed the RWE Green Bond Framework under which it will issue green bonds and the use of proceeds to finance renewable energy production units, specifically solar energy, onshore and offshore wind farms. Sustainalytics considers that the project s funded by the green bond proceeds will provid e positive environmental impact by increasing low - carbon electricity production. The RWE Green Bond Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the RWE Green Bond Framework is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use of proceed s category will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 7. Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that RWE has adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that RWE is well - positioned to issue green bonds and that th e RWE Green Bond Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018. 12 Eurostat, “SHARES”, at: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/data/shares 13 IEA, “Energy Policies of IEA Countries – United States 2019 Review”, (2019), at: https://webstore.iea.org/download/direct/2829?fileName=United_States_2019_Review.pdf,Second - Party Opinion RWE Green Bond Framework 7 Appendices Ap pendix 1 : Green Bond / Green Bond Programme - External Review Form Section 1.

Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures , such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an as sessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds fro m Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a re cognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an establi shed scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion RWE Green Bond Framework 12 Disclaimer Copyright ©2020 Sustainalytics.
