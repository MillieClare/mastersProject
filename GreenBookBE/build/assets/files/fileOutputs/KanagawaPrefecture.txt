(R&I) has confirmed the alignment of the Kanagawa Prefecture Green Bond Framework of Kanagawa Prefecture dated September 24, 2020 with the “Green Bond Principles 2018" and the Ministry of the Environment's “Green Bond Guidelines 2020." This opinion is based on the following views.  Overview of the Opinion (1) Use of Proceeds Proceeds will be allocated to finance new projects related to rivers, coasts, and erosion control under the “Kanagawa Prefecture Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy.” The Kanagawa prefectural government assessed the impact of climate change to conclude that it would have unavoidable impact even with the maximum level of mitigation for greenhouse gas emissions. In order to adapt to such climate change, it formulated a regional climate change adaptation plan (the Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan) and positions the Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy as a concrete adaptation measure to flood disasters. R&I ha s confirmed that the eligible projects cover rivers, coasts, and mountainous districts and that their measures are applicable to flood disasters caused by climate change. In addition, we have confirmed how the environmental and social implications of the project will be dealt with. The eligible projects fall under the category of the Green Bond Principles, ‘climate change adaptation.’ (2) Process for Project Evaluation and Selection With the “Kanagawa Climate Emergency Declaration” as its policy for dealing with climate change, it identifies disasters caused by climate change that need to be dealt with under the “Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan” and formulates specific measures in the “Kanagawa Prefecture Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy.” The eligible projects are included in the Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy. The Declaration, Plan, and individual projects are formulated and selected based on relevant laws, ordinances, etc. Expert meetings and procedu res to reflect the opinions of the people of the prefecture ensure expertise and fairness. (3) Management of Proceeds Finance Division of the Kanagawa Prefectural Government cooperates with departments in charge of the eligible projects to grasp the allocation status of proceeds and records in the book using accounting classifications in accordance wi th the accounting system. The allocation of funds will be completed within the same fiscal year as the funding year under the principle of fiscal year independence. Accounting documents to be prepared for revenues and expenditures, including allocation results, are subject to audit by the Kanagawa Prefectural Auditor and approval by the Prefectural Assembly, thereby ensuring objectivity. (4) Reporting We have confirmed that reporting including the allocation status of proceeds and environmental benefits will be disclosed on the Kanagawa Prefecture’s website annually until the allocation of funds is completed. Indicators including th ose that show the execution of the eligible projects will be disclosed so that environmental benefits can be confirmed.,Second Opinion 2/12 Outline of the Issuer  Kanagawa Prefecture has a population of approximately 9.2 million people, second only to Tokyo among the prefectures, with a high population density of approximately 3,800 people/km2, second only to the prefectures of Tokyo and Osaka. Its area is approximately 2,416 km2 and roughly divided into three geographical areas: the mountainous western part and hilly and costal eastern part with the central part on plains and plateaus. As for rivers, there are 38 Class A rivers of 3 river systems with the total length of approx. 342.8 km, and 81 Class B rivers of 23 river systems that are about 515.7 km long. Class A rivers of the Tama, Sagami, and Tsurumi Rivers are managed by the national government, however the designated sections are administered by the prefectural government. Class B rivers are managed by the prefectural government, while part of the Sakai River is managed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The total length under the prefecture’s management is about 762.4 kilometers long for 114 rivers of 26 rivers systems, when Class A and B rivers are combined.  In addition to areas with large population and many business establishments including Yokohama City and Kawasaki City, it has a rich natural environment represented by the hot springs of Hakone and Yugawara which are part of the national parks, the mountains of Tanzawa and four prefectural natural parks. Therefore, in the ev ent of a natural disaster, significant impact on the residents and nature is anticipated.  Many rivers run through densely populated areas to the east of the Sagami River which runs in the center of the prefecture. With the ground surface being covered with concrete, etc. as urbanization progresses, the water retention function, etc. inherent in the watershed has deteriorated. At the same time, as assets are increasingly accumulated in areas where floods are expected, there is a risk that damage caused by river flooding will be enormous. With regards to small and medium-sized rivers running through the urban areas, there is a risk that localized torrential rains result in a rapid rise in water level, which may cause flooding damage.  Its coasts border the Sea of Sagami to the south and Tokyo Bay to the east. Both coasts suffered damages caused by storm surges and tsunamis in the past. Coastal facilities and houses, etc. are often damaged by typhoons as well.  As measures against climate change, Kanagawa Prefecture enacted the “Kanagawa Prefecture’s Ordinance to Promote Global Warming Countermeasures” in July 2009 and established the “Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan” in March of the following year. It was initially a plan for mitigation measures to combat global warming. Subsequently in October 2016, revisions were made to add adaptation measures, etc. With those revisions, the plan is positioned as a ‘local climate change adaptation plan’ based on the Article 12 of the “Climate Change Adaptation Act.”  In response to the damage, etc. caused by a series of typhoons, the “Kanagawa Climate Emergency Declaration” was issued in March 2020 in order to share and ‘act’ on the ‘sense of crisis’ that the climate is in a state of emergency. One of its main initiatives is the publication of the “Kanagawa Prefecture Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy.”  For rivers and coasts under its jurisdiction as a local government, Kanagawa Prefecture formulated the ‘Basic Plan for River Development’ and ‘Basic Plan for Coastal Conservation,’ etc. in accordance with the River Act and the Coast Act, respectively, and are taking various measures.,Second Opinion 3/12 1. Use of Proceeds (1) Eligible Projects  The following projects relating to rivers, coasts, and erosion control in the “Kanagawa Prefecture Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy” formulated in February 2020 are eligible for the allocation of funds. They fall under the category of ‘climate change adaptation’ for the purpose of the Green Bond Principles. Projects eligible for the allocation and their outline Possible phenomena expected from climate change Current and future impacts and risks expected under the Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan (1) Infrastructure-related measures to minimize damage through urgent implementation Emergency response for rivers Rivers (flooding and inland water) Inundation and damage to facilities caused by rainfall exceeding what is assumed for the current level of development Inundation damage due to heavy rain in a short period of time (2) Infrastructure-related projects to accelerate initiatives from a medium- to long-term perspective Development of detention basins and improvement of bottleneck points, etc. in watercourses Rivers (flooding and inland water) Inundation and damage to facilities caused by rainfall exceeding what is assumed for the current level of development Inundation damage due to heavy rain in a short period of time Development of coastal conservation facilities, etc. Storm surges/high waves Increased risk of storm surges/high waves Development of sediment disaster prevention facilities Debris flows, landslides, etc. Debris flows, landslides, etc.  In recent years, typhoons and training1 brought record-breaking heavy rains and storms, resulting in extensive damage caused by floods and sediment disasters. Global warming is considered to be the main cause of these meteorological disasters.  Internationally, IPCC’s2 most recent 5th Assessment Report shows that human activities are very likely to be the dominant factor in global warming observed since the 20th century (95% chance or higher) and that atmospheric concentrations of CO2, methane and N2O which are greenhouse gases have increased to unprecedented levels in the last 800,000 years. Looking forward, it projects that the global average surface temperature is likely to change by 0.3 to 4.8° C and the global average sea level is likely to rise by 0.26 to 0.82m by the end of the 21th c entury, and that the total cumulative CO2 emissions will be proportional to changes in the global average surface temperature. It then develops3 four levels of RCP scenarios for GHG emissions 4to assess emissions and temperature changes. Further, while it calls measures to reduce and absorb GHG emissions as ‘mitigation,’ it considers those that assume new climate conditions as ‘adaptation,’ which it argues need to be incorporated into future regional plans in preparation for preventing and mitigating the impact of climate change that are unavoidable even with the maximum mitigation.  The Ministry of the En vironment released a report 5 that predicts the impact on Japan by using RCP 1 It means ‘areas of rain, associated with heavy rainfalls, that are line-shaped with the length of about 50 to 300 km and width of 20 to 50 km, resulting from an organized group of cumulonimbus clouds which are a string of developed rain clouds (cumulonimbus clouds) which develop continuously that move along the almost same path or stay over the almost same region.’ (From the Glossary on the Japan Meteorological Agency’s website) 2 An abbreviation of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It is an organization established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to conduct comprehensive assessments from scientific, technical and socioeconomic perspectives of anthropogenic climate change, as well as its impacts, adaptation and mitigation measures. 3 It refers to Green House Gas 4 Representative Concentration Pathways scenarios 5 Ministry of the Environment, Environment Research and Technology Development Fund, S-8 2014 Report, “Global Warming: Impact on Japan - Comprehensive Impact Projections and Adaptation Measures Based on New Scenarios -”,Second Opinion 4/12 scenarios and assesses the effect of adaptation measures on risk reduction. Historically, in addition to measures including the “Kyoto Protocol Target Achievement Plan,” it revised the “Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures” in March 2016 and promulgated the “Climate Change Adaptation Act” in June 2018. In response, the cabinet approved the “Climate Change Adaptation Plan” in November 2018.  The “Climate Change Adaptation Plan” describes the basic direction of measures relating to climate change adaptation (targets, plan periods, basic roles of relevant parties, basic strategies, progress management, etc.), measures by field, and fundamental measures. Adaptation measures cover a wide range of fields, including agriculture, forestry an d fisheries, water environment/resources, natural ecosystems, health, industrial/economic activities, and people’s/urban lives. Therefore, with many people involved for each field, it clarifies their specific roles.  Kanagawa Prefecture, as a local government, plays a major role in promoting local adaptation measures and adaptation by local stakeholders and, accordingly, has formulated a regional plan required by the Climate Change Adaptation Act and is promoting various measures. It is the “Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan” that corresponds to such regional plan.  The Climate Change Adaptation Plan in the “Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan” expects that even under the RCP 2.66 scenario which assumes the most stringent global warming countermeasures, a wide range of areas in Japan will be affected. Under the recognition that the annual average temperature in Kanagawa Prefecture has increased by 1.8°C per 100 years and that the highest temperature since the start of the statistics was renewed (37.4°C) in August 2013, it predicts the temperature to increase by 0.4 to 1.8°C and the number of days with the highest temperature rising above 30°C to increase by about 10 to 60 days in the region. In considering adaptation measures, Kanagawa Prefecture determined the impact of global warming based on these projections and summarized its assessment.  Based on the impact assessment in the opinion of the government’s Central Environment Council of Japan, the following criteria were used to extract ev ents that are considered to have particularly large impact on Kanagawa Prefecture. Criteria to extract events considered to be significantly affected by climate change7 [1] Those for which ‘severity’ is ‘particularly high’ with both ‘urgency’ and ‘confidence level’ considered to be ‘high,’ and which are applicable to Kanagawa Prefecture [2] While there is scientific uncertainty in ‘c onfidence level,’ phenomena that have already been confirmed in Kanagawa Prefecture, and their ‘severity’ is ‘particularly high’ and ‘urgency’ is ‘high’ [3] Others that are considered to be particularly applicable in Kanagawa Prefecture  The events extracted include natural disasters in rivers, coasts, and mountains which are covered by the “Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy” (floods, inland waters, high tides/waves, coastal erosion, debris flows/landslides, etc.). The measures for the events considered to have large impact include the eligible projects in the transaction. Since Kanagawa Prefecture has been implementing measures to help adapt to global warming, such measures are also included in the plan. The government’s “Climate Change Adaptation Plan” clearly states that “we will also continue to steadily develop the levees, flood control facilities, sewerage systems, and others that we have been working on8.” In addition to continuing with existing infrastructure -related measures for disasters with a hi gh probability of occurrence, it aims to protect human lives and avoid catastrophic damage to the society and economy by taking measures including those on the intangible aspects with regards to the largest possible disasters.  The “Flood Prevention Strategy” summarizes concrete measures related to flood prevention in response to the “Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan” and “Kanagawa Climate Emergency 6 ‘RCP 2.6’ is a scenario that assumes the lowest level of emissions, developed with the goal of keeping future temperature increases below 2°C (so-called ‘2°C target’). 7 Excerpt from the Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan 8 Excerpt from the Climate Change Adaptation Plan, Chapter 4, Section 1,Second Opinion 5/12 Declaration.” As such, the impact of climate change in Kanagawa Prefecture was assessed to be unavoidable even under the RCP 2.6 scenario of the “Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan,” based on which the “Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy” has been formulated. (2) Environmental Benefits  The “Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy,” in which the eligible projects are listed, consists of the following three measures. By stepping up infrastructure-related measures as well as those related to the intangible aspects centered on the evacuation of residents, it aims to achieve the targets such as preventing and delaying the occurrence of flood damage, which is expected to occur frequently in the future, to minimize the impact. The eligible projects are measures that belong to (1) and (2). [1] Infrastructure-related measures to minimize damage through urgent implementation [2] Infrastructure-related projects to accelerate initiatives from a medium- to long-term perspective [3] Measures related to the intangible aspects with aview to strengthening disaster response capabilities  Emergency response to the rivers that belongs to (1) is projects that require immediate response and prompt improvement, including raising levees in parts where flooding has occurred, and removing sedimentary soil and sand in sections where the risk of flooding is particularly high with a risk of damage when the water levels rise. On the other hand, the development of detention basins and improvement of bottlenecks, etc. in wate rcourses, development of coastal conservation facilities, etc., and development of sediment disaster prev ention facilities, which belong to (2), are repair and improvement projects in anticipation of future disasters.  These are flood control projects for climate disasters that are becoming more severe and frequent due to climate change. The flood control projects consist mainly of passive measures against disasters such as dredging to cope with the increase in water levels due to heavy/concentrated rain, improving water channels such as levees, and erosion control dam works, slope works and anchor works to cope with debris flows, etc., active measures to directly control water flow such as disaster prevention operations by dams, etc., and evacuation and disaster reduction measures such as preparation and dissemination of hazard maps incorporating inundation prediction and information sharing when a disaster is predicted. As such, the eligible projects directly contribute to disaster mitigation/prevention, play a role in responding to disasters anticipated under the flood control projects, and constitute the Climate Change Adaptation Plan, together with evacuation measures such as hazard maps.  In light of the above, the environm ental benefits of individual eligible projects have been confirmed as follows. Emergency response for rivers The project mainly concerns the removal of soil and sand accumulated by past floods, felling of trees, and raising of concrete where sandbags are placed all the time, and represents emergency response to where expected effects have not been achieved. The project will be executed with the aim of preventing or reducing flood damage that is likely to occur freq uently in the future, and the number of sites by construction work type has been confirmed. The sites at which construction work is to be carried out can be expected to have the capacity of their current facilities put to sufficient use. Development of detention basins and improvement of bottleneck points, etc. in watercourses The project mainly concerns the development of detention basins which adjust the flow rate by flooding from a river when its water levels rise, and the replacement of railway bridges which will widen the width of the river at the bottleneck sites. The former adjusts the water levels in the downstream areas when the river water levels increase, and the latter reduces the possibility of flooding when the river water levels rise by increasing the width of the river to improve carrying capacity. The project differs from revetment repair, etc. in that it aims at lowering the water levels, rather than concerning facilities that are durable,Second Opinion 6/12 against rising water levels, and we have confirmed its effect through reductions in the size of inundated areas, population in the inundated areas, and the estimated damage. Development of coastal conservation facilities, etc. It is a project to prioritize the development of coastal protection facilities, such as revetments, with respect to coasts that suffered damage to their backlands in recent years due to storm surges and high waves, among those with insufficient levee height, wave dissipating functions, etc. for the purpose of the Basic Plan for Coastal Conservation. The number of coasts at which the development work is to be carried out has been confirmed, and protection from tidal waves and tsunamis anticipated under the Basic Plan for Coastal Conservation can be expected. Development of sediment disaster prevention facilities Sediment disaster prevention facilities include er osion control dam works to prevent debris flow which is caused by the s udden flow of sediment from the hills ide and riverbed to the downstream due to heavy rain, etc., riverbed cons olidation works to prevent the outflow of sediment from the riverbed, mountain stream conservation works such as revetment works to protect the riverbank with stones and concrete, and anchor works to prevent landslide caused by the rise of groundwater, etc. which permeates the land due to heavy rain, etc., and slope works, etc, to prevent landslide. Those facilities are provided in the areas designated as erosion control areas, landslide prevention areas, and steep slope areas in danger of failure by the Erosion Control Act, Landslide Prevention Act, and Steep Slope FailureAct9, respectively, based on the standards of the respective laws. The number of the areas in which construction work is to be carried out and that of construction sites have been confirmed for each project. The sites at which construction work is to be carried out can be expected to have the effect of preventing sediment disasters. Indicators to show environmental benefits for each project are in the following table. In addition, with respect to projects subsidized by the government, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism carries out assessment at the time of adopt ion of new projects, with information including cost/benefit assessment being disclosed10. Eligible projects Project sites, etc. Environmental benefits indicators Emergency response for rivers River improvement project expenses Dredging and tree felling Sagami River, Sakawa River, Kaname River, etc. River bed excavation/tree felling: 72 sites at 38 rivers Emergency work for raising concrete, etc.: 7 sites at 7 rivers Emergency repair work for the deteriorated parts: 17 sites at 15 rivers River maintenance and improvement project expenses Raising concrete, etc. Emergency levee improvement, etc. Sanno River, Mekujiri River, Sakai River Uta River, Kaname River, Sakawa River, etc. River repair expenses Dredging and tree felling Sagami River, Sakawa River, Kaname River, etc. Development of detention basins and improvement of bottleneck points, etc. in watercourses River improvement project expenses Development of detention basins Replacement of railway bridges Hikiji River, Sakai River, Kashio River, etc. Sanno River and Sakai River 6 projects 2 projects Effect of the improvement in the 9 Act on Prevention of Disasters Caused by Steep Slope Failure 10 (Reference) List of assessment results at the time of adoption of new projects in the FY2020 budgethttps://www.mlit.go.jp/tec/hyouka/public/kisha/200331R01/pdf/06.pdf,Second Opinion 7/12 event of flood on a scale anticipated in the plan in the project sections Inundated areas: about 75ha ⇒ 0ha Population within inundated areas: approx. 1,360 ⇒ 0 Estimated damage: 9 billion yen ⇒ 0 yen Development of coastal conservation facilities, etc. Project expenses for coastal storm surge countermeasures Coastal conservation facilities such as revetments Odawara Coast, Hayama Coast, etc. 4 coasts Development of sediment disaster prevention facilities Regular erosion control project expenses Erosion control dam works, etc. 29 sites 11 municipalities Disaster prevention and erosion control project expenses Mountain stream conservation works, etc. 23 sites 12 municipalities Erosion control facility improvement expenses Revetment repair work, etc. 10 sites 7 municipalities Landslide prevention project expenses Anchor works, etc. 6 sites 4 municipalities Steep slope area failure prevention project expenses Slope works, etc. 189 sites 21 municipalities Steep slope area facility improvement expenses Slope works, etc. 12 sites 7 municipalities  The expected disaster prevention effect will be brought about through measures based on laws and regulations including the River Act and the Coast Act as well as the Basic Plan for River Development and Basic Plan for Coastal Conservation, generating environmental benefits as adaptation measures to the impact of climate change in all implementation sites of the eligible projects. We have confirmed that measures related to the intangible aspects which are not part of the eligible projects will add to disaster mitigation effects in the event of a disaster beyond the scale anticipated under the plan, and will serve as climate change adaptation measures for Kanagawa Prefecture. (3) Consideration for Negative Environmental and Social Impacts  Impact on the local natural environment, etc. is ex pected depending on the areas where the eligible projects are implemented and the construction method. In all projects, the assessment of environmental impacts is carried out in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Act and the ordinances established by Kanagawa Prefecture.  From a social point of view, there is a possibility that residents’ voices, etc. concerning danger may not be reflected in the eligible projects, however, there is a mechanism that takes in their voices, for example, in making designation of steep slope areas in danger of failure at their requests. Proceeds will be allocated to finance new projects related to rivers, coasts, and erosion control under the “Kanagawa Prefecture Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy.” The Kanagawa prefectural government assessed the impact of climate change to conclude that it would have unavoidable impact even with the maximum level,Second Opinion 8/12 of mitigation for greenhouse gas emissions. In order to adapt to such climate change, it formulated a regional climate change adaptation plan (the Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan) and positions the Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy as a concrete adaptation measure to flood disasters. R&I has confirmed that the eligible projects cover rivers, coasts, and mountainous districts and that their measures are applicable to flood disasters caused by climate change. In addition, we have confirmed how the environmental and social implications of the project will be dealt with. The eligible projects fall under the category of the Green Bond Principles, ‘climate change adaptation.’,Second Opinion 9/12 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection (1) Incorporation into Comprehensive Objectives, Strategies and so on  Kanagawa Prefecture has issued its “Kanagawa Climate Emergency Declaration” that declares climate emergency with a view to sharing its ‘sense of crisis’ that climate is in a crisis mode with municipalities, businesses, the academia, organizations and prefectural residents, and ‘acting’ together. In terms of the pillars of its basic stance, with the philosophy of t he SDGs of ‘leaving no one behind” in mind, it intends to work with the “All Kanagawa” lineup going forward, with the following as its three basic pillars toward a goal of realizing ‘sustainable Kanagawa that protects the lives of the prefectural residents’: [1] Strengthening measures against wind and flood damage, etc. to protect the lives of the people today; [2] Promoting initiatives toward the realization of a ‘decarbonized society’ in 2050 in order to protect future lives; and [3] Enhancing information offering/dissemination and public awareness to share climate change issues  The “Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan” has been established as a basic plan for comprehensive and systematic promotion of measures relating to the global warming countermeasures of Kanagawa Prefecture. The plan is positioned as a ‘action plans of local governments (regional policy)’ in accordance with the Article 21, paragraph 3, of the “Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures” and a ‘local climate change adaptation plan’ in accordance with the Article 12 of the “Climate Change Adaptation Act.”  The “Kanagawa Prefecture Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy” which includes the eligible projects is positioned as a concrete measure in the Declaration and Plan. (2) Criteria for Project Evaluation and Selection  The impact of climate change in Kanagawa Prefecture is shown in the “Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan” and the projects in the Fl ood Disaster Prevention Strategy are selected as measures to minimize the damage of meteorological disasters caused by climate change.  The Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy has defined in-scope disasters as those resulting from floods, landslides, storm surges, windstorms, etc. caused by typhoons and heavy rains, and has selected projects aiming at minimizing damage from flood disasters and landslides, as well as promoting appropriate evacuation behavior by residents. (3) Process for Project Evaluation and Selection  The “Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan” which is the main criterion for evaluation and selection, was drafted by the Global Warming Prevention Measures Plan Review Committee consisting of experts, and formulated by the K anagawa Prefectural Assembly after going through the procedure for reflecting the opinions of the people of the prefecture, collecting the opinions of the municipalities, and holding the Kanagawa Global Environment Preservation Promotion Council 11 in accordance with the “Kanagawa Prefectural Ordinance to Promote Global Warming Countermeasures.”  Each project under the Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy is selected in accordance with the related laws and regulations as well as the project evaluation and selection criteria established by Kanagawa Prefecture in addition to the abovementioned Plan, and all projects are developed after the assessment of environmental impacts based on the Environmental Impact Assessment Act and the ordinances 11 Established as a body to promote the Kanagawa Action Guidelines for Global Environmental Conservation, “Kanagawa Eco 10 Trials: Our Declaration of Environmental Actions,” which was formulated by the prefectural residents, businesses, and administrative bodies. It consists of the prefectural residents, business operators, and administrative bodies.,Second Opinion 10/12 established by Kanagawa Prefecture. With the “Kanagawa Climate Emergency Declaration” as its policy for dealing with climate change, it identifies disasters caused by clim ate change that need to be dealt with under the “Kanagawa Prefecture Global Warming Prevention Plan” and formulates specific measures in the “Kanagawa Prefecture Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy.” The eligible projects are included in the Flood Disaster Prevention Strategy. The Declaration, Plan, and individual projects are formulated and selected based on relevant laws, ordinances, etc. Expert meetings and procedures to reflect the opinions of the people of the prefecture ensure expertise and fairness. 3. Management of Proceeds  Based on the principle of fiscal year independence12, the expenditures during each fiscal year by a local government is financed by revenues including proceeds from its local government bonds during the same fiscal year, and thus the entire proceeds will be allocated to the eligible projects within the fiscal year of funding.  Finance Department works with departments in charge to grasp the allocation status and manage it so that there will be no unallocated funds. The amount of proceeds will be less than the budgeted cost of projects eligible for allocation.  Specifically, the allocation of funds to the eligible projects will be managed by classifying into accounting categories in accordance with the Kanagawa Prefecture accounting system, and recording the use of funds and the amount of expenditures clearly on the books.  The execution results and accounting documents to be prepared for all the revenues and expenditures of Kanagawa Prefecture, including those for the eligible projects, at the end of the fiscal year, are subject to audit by the prefectural auditor. The accounting documents are then subject to approval by the prefectural assembly, together with the opinion of the auditor.  Unallocated funds will be managed in highly safe liquid assets in accordance with the Kanagawa prefectural government's regulations. Finance Division of the Kanagawa Prefectural Government cooperates with departments in charge of the eligible projects to grasp the allocation status of proceeds and records in the book using accounting classifications in accordance with the accounting system. The allocation of funds will be completed within the same fiscal year as the funding year under the principle of fiscal year independence. Accounting documents to be prepared for revenues and expenditures, including allocation results, are subject to audit by the Kanagawa Prefectural Auditor and approval by the Prefectural Assembly, thereby ensuring objectivity. 12 Article 208 of the Local Autonomy Act,Second Opinion 11/12 4.

Second Party Opinion : An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. 2. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. 3. Certification : An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. 4. Green Bond Scoring/Rating : An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 ‐ degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.
