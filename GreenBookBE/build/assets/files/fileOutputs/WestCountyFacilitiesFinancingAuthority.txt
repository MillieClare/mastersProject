The Project will increase storage capacity to accommodate large storm events, reduc e potential for release of untreated water across the system, instal l solar arrays, improve biosolids recovery and upgrade the anaerobic digester and cogeneration system s . The Project is expected to reduce wastewater treatment plant greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 93% and solar arrays are expect ed to reduce grid energy demand by approximately 20%. The B onds align with the Sustainable Wastewater Management and Renewable Energy eligible project categories under the Green Bond Principles. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection The Bonds fina nce activities which directly align with the District’s core mission, goals to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2031, goals to become a carbon negative enterprise, and strategic goals related to environmental stewardship. Projects were originally iden tified through an integrated master planning process . Management of Proceeds Bond proceeds shall be allocated to a separately managed subaccount and used to pay for the Project. A portion of proceeds will also finance costs of issuanc e. Proceeds may be held in temporary investments in accordance with the Permitted Investments defined in the Indenture. Reporting The District and the Authority commit to posting continuing disclosures to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board annually through the Electro nic Municipal Market Access (“EMMA”) system. T he District will also produce annual report s on the allocation of Bond procee ds and post these reports on EMMA until all proceeds have been spent , or approximately 18 months . After the Project is operational, r eports on renewable energy generation from the cogeneration and solar systems are expected to be available on the District’s website . Impact and Alignment with United Nation Sustainable Development Goals By financing digester upgrades, resource recovery infrastructure, solar arrays, and upgrades to the wastewater collection and treatment system, the Bonds support and advance multiple UN SDGs, including,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion Executive Summary ii Goals 6: Clean Water and Sanitation , 7: Affordable and C lean Energy , 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure , and 12: Responsible Consumption and Production .,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 1 Second Party Opinion Issuer: West County Facilities Financing Authority Issue Description: 2021 Wastewater Revenue Bonds (Green Bonds) Project: Wastewater System Improvements Green Standard: Green Bond Principles Green Categor ies : Sustainable Wastewater Management Renewable Energ y Par: $ 79,575,000 Evaluation Date: September 9 , 2021 GREEN BONDS DESIGNATION Kestrel Verifiers, an Approved Verifier accredited by the Climate Bonds Initiative, conducted an independent external review of this bond to evaluate conformance with the Green Bond Principles (June 20 21 ) established by the International Capital Market Association. This Second Party Opinion reflects our review of the uses and allocation of proceeds an d oversight and conformance of the bonds with the Green Bond Principles. In our opinion, the 2021 Wastewater Revenue Bonds (“Bonds”) are aligned with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles and qualify for green bonds designation. ABOUT THE I SSUER The West County Facilities Financing Authority (“Authority”) was created in 2021 under a joint exercise of powers agreement between West Cou n ty Wastewater District (the “District”) and the California Statewide Communities Development Authority for the purpose of financing and refinancing capital improvement projects for the District . The Bonds issued by the Authority will directly benefit the District and the system it operates. California Statewide Communities Development Authority wi ll have no other role in the bond financing . The District was founded in 1921 with a primary purpose of collecting and treating wastewater in its service area. L ocated entirely in western Contra Costa County , the District serves the C ity of San Pablo and parts of the City of Pinole, City of Richmond, the communities of Tara Hills, North Richmond, East Richmond Heights, El Sobrante, Rollingwood, and Bayview and unincorporated areas of the county . The system serves approximately 34,000 residenti al accounts and 900 commercial and industrial businesses. The District operates 249 miles of sewer pipelines, 17 lift stations, six miles of pressure force mains, and on e wastewater treatment plant, the Water Quality Resource and Recovery Plant (“WQRRP”) , that has a c apacity of 12.5 million gallons per day . Water treated at the WQRRP is delivered to East Bay Municipal Utility District , specifically to the Richmond Treatment Plant , for additional treatment and distribution as recycled water for irrigation, industrial, and other non - potable uses .,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 2 The District has a history of environmental stewardship, as evidenced by reliable conformance with strict regulations and by its pursui t of innovative projects to reduce impacts . The District r eceived the Platinum Pe ak Performance Award from National Association of Clean Water Agencies (“NACWA”) in 2019 . The award is the highest possible recognition from NACWA and demonstrate s complete compliance the EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System regulations fo r 1 4 consecutive years. A recent solar development also illustrates the District’s commitment to stewardship ; t hrough a collaboration with Premier Power and Solar Power Partners, Inc, a site contaminated from historic use as sludge storage was re p urposed for stormwater detention and a 10 - acre solar farm. ALIGNMENT TO GREEN STANDARDS Green Bonds are any type of bond instrument where the proceeds will be exclusively applied to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new and/or existing eligible Green Projects and which are aligned with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles (International Capital Mark et Association definition). Use of Proceeds The Bonds will be used to finance the Comprehensive Energy and Sustainability Upgrades Project which include s replacement and modernization of equipment and infrastructure at the WQRRP, as well as installation of solar photovoltaic generation facilities and upgrades to increase sustainability of operations ( “Project”) . The purpose of the P roject is to reduce energy consumption and improve operational efficiency. The activities are eligible p roject s as defined by the Green Bond Principles in the project categories of Sustainable Wastewater Management and Renewable Energy . Approximately $7 1 million of Bond proceeds will be used for the Energy and Sustainability Upgrades Project (Table 1) which is expected to result in annual energy savings of 26,247 kWh at the headquarters office and 129,683 kWh at the WQRRP . Approximately $ 1 9 million will finance replacement of force mains and gravity sewer mains. Appen dix B provides a more detailed brea kdown of uses of proceeds of the Bonds. The environmental benefits of the Project are discussed in detail in Table 1 and include the following: • Decrease wastewater treatment plant greenhouse gas emissions by 93% 1 • Maximize biogas yield from anaerobic dige sters • Increase storage capacity to accommodate a 100 - year storm event • Reduce potential for sewage overflows and release of untreated water across the system • Maximize resource recovery through production of biosolids for soil amendment • Maximize resource re covery through cogeneration facilities to harness waste heat • Reduce energy demand by approximately 20% through installation of solar arrays and energy efficiency upgrades Table 1. Purpose and environmental benefit of p rojects to be fully or partially finan ced with the Bonds . The majority of activities are part of the District’s Comprehensive Energy and Sustainability Upgrades Project. Bond - F inanced P roject Description Influent Pumps Upgrade Pumps raise wastewater to allow it to flow through the WQRRP by gravity. New influent pumps will and more reliably adapt to changes in influent flow and reduce energy use. Grit Removal System Upgrade Upgrades w ill more effectively remove sand and other particles larger than 75 micron s ( approximately the size of a human hair) . Grit removal reduces wear on equipment and supports efficient operation of biogas digesters. 1 Based on the Biosolids Emissions Assessment Model (BEAM ), annual emission s are expected to decrease from 6,313 M t CO 2 e to 430 M t CO 2 e . Green Standard Eligible Project Categor ies : ▪ Sustainable Wastewater Management ▪ Renewable Energy,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 3 Bond - F inanced P roject Description Carbon Redirection in the Primary Clarifiers Re d ucing biochemical oxygen demand improves the production of primary sludge , and ultimately, increases potential biogas yield. High Efficiency Turbo Blowers Install Blowers are used t o stimulate breakdown of waste by microorganisms through aeration of the activated sludge. The existing blowers require replacement. Upgrades will red uce maintenance costs and increase efficiencies. Redundant Rotary Drum Thickener Install Sludge is thickened prior to digestion by microorganisms to produce biogas. Two new rotary drum thickeners will be installed to maximize biogas prod uction. Anaerobic Digester Install Two existing digesters will be replaced with new digesters (approximately 68 feet in diameter, each). Biogas Cogeneration System Install Any biogas produced through the digester requires treatment to remove hydrogen sul fide (metal corrosion concern) and siloxanes ( becomes abrasive when combusted) . Installation of two new cogeneration systems (450 kilowatt each) will (1) generate power from treated biogas and (2) harness waste heat that will be used to heat the digester a nd to dry biosolids. The cogeneration building will be approximately 10 feet wide and 78 feet long. Centrifuge Install Currently, dewatering (removing liquids) from remaining sludge after digestion is achieved by leaving sludge in sludge ponds. Install of two new centrifuges will allow for faster separation of liquids and solids and eliminate greenhouse gas emissions associated with the open - air sludge ponds. Install of Thermal Dryer for Digested Sludge A thermal dryer will be installed to dry biosolids that remain after digestion . Waste heat from the cogeneration system will be used to operate the dryer. Dried biosolids meet “Class A” s tandards so the product can be used as a soil amendment for non - food crops. In crease Capacity of the Influent Equalization Basins Influent storage capacity in equalization basin will be increased from 53 million gallons to 76 million gallons. In creased storage is necessary to accommodate large rain events and related stormwater in fl ux. Solar Photovoltaic Facility Install Install of solar panels at the headquarters building, WQRRP, and three pump stations will increase generation of renewables. The total installed capacity of the planned arrays is approximately 1.1 MW. LED Lighting Improvements Lighting upgrades in the headquarters building and WQRRP will reduce energy use and maintenance costs . Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Two electric vehicle charging stations will be installed at the headquarters building . Force Main Upgr ades * Replacement of aging and inadequate force mains will reduce need for emergency repairs. Assessments of all force mains are in progress. Gravity Sewer Upgrades * Maintenance and improvements on gravity sewer mains are necessary to ensure system reliability and reduce inflow and infiltration of stormwater , which can * Activities are not part of the Energy and Sustainability Upgrades Project,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 4 Bond - F inanced P roject Description overwhelm the collection system . A comprehensive inflow and infiltration study identified priority areas for maintenance across the 249 mile collection system . Process for Project Evaluation and Selection The bond - financed Project was identified through a master planning process initiated in 2011 and directly aligns with the environmental stewardship objectives articulated in the District’s Strategic Goals and Climate Action Plan. The District uses an integrated master planning approach to ensure all facets of facilities and operations are considered in the project prioritization process. The District - wide Master Plan was initiated in 2011 to evaluate existing infrastructure, including the WQRRP , the collection system, and supporting facilit ies . The Master Plan , which was adopted in December 2014, included a recommended 20 year Capital Improvement Plan. The Project to be financed by the Bonds was identified in this Capital Improvement Plan. Parallel to t he Master Plan , the District uses the Effective Utility Management (“EUM”) framework t o measure its effectiveness in achieving the utility’s primary mission. The EUM framework was develo ped by the American Water Works Association, Water Environment Federation, National Association of Clean Water Agencies, and the US Environmental Protection Agency. Through use of the EUM framework, the District’s mission, goals, and objectives are frequen tly re - evaluated and documented in the Strategic Plan. The Project directly aligns with the District’s Strategic Goals 1 and 2 and the objectives of each that are outlined in the Strategic Plan . By financing the sustainability improvements and upgrades to increase reliability and energy efficiency, t he Project advances these goals: • Strategic Goal 1 : Adopt infrastructure maintenance and modernization strategies that maximize performance, reduce risk and ensure reliable service in collaboration with local, re gional and national partners to further the mission of the District • Strategic Goal 2 : Be an environmental steward in our community through a commitment to reducing carbon emissions, maximizing resource recovery, minimizing our environmental footprint and m aking significant strides toward becoming a carbon - neutral enterprise. In addition to advancing the vision in the Strategic Plan, the Project is a direct implementation of t he District’s Climate Action Plan which was adopted in A pril 2019. The Climate Action Plan set an organizational goal of eliminating the District’s carbon footprint entirely by December 31, 2031, and establishing its status as a Carbon Negative enterprise . Management of Proceeds Bond proceeds shall be allocated to a separately managed subaccount ( Project Fund ) and used to pay for the Project. A portion of proceeds will also finance costs of issuance. Proceeds may be held in temporary investments in accordance with the Permitted Investments defined in the Indenture . Th ese allowable temporary investments consist of instruments including, but not limited to, money market funds, certificates of deposit, and bonds or notes guaranteed by US federal agencies or the US government. Reporting The District and the Authority inten d to submit continuing disclosures to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ( “ MSRB ” ) so long as the Bonds are outstanding. The Authority will also provide reports in the event of material developments. This reporting will be done annually on the Electr onic Municipal Market Access ( “ EMMA ” ) system operated by the MSRB. The Authority has also committed to preparing a Green Bond Project Report to provide assurance on the allocation of proceeds to the wastewater sustainability and energy efficiency projects. This reporting will be completed annually until all proceeds have been spent , or approximately 18 months . The form of this report is included in Appendix G of the official stateme nt .
