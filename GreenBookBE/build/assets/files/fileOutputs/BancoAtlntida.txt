Founded in 1913, the Bank has 190 branches in all 18 departments of the country. The Bank has de veloped the Banco Atlántida Green Bond Framework (the “ framework ”) under which it is plann ing to issue a green bond and use the proceeds to finance and refinance, in whole or in part, e xisting and future renewable energy projects in Honduras . The framework further spe cifies project subcategories in the areas of:  Solar Energy  Wind Energy  Biomass Energy (from sustainable sources)  Sm all Hydropower Energy (up to 2 5 MW installed capacity) Banco Atlántida engaged Sustainalytics to review the Banco Atlántida Green Bond Framework and provide a second - party opinion on the alignment of the green bond with the Green Bond Principles , 201 8 , as administered by the International Capital Market Association (the “ICMA”) , 1 and the framework’s environmental credentials. This framewo rk has been published in a separate document . 2 As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of the Bank's management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds , as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Bank ’s green bond. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Banco Atlántida Green Bond Framew ork and should be read in conjunction with that framework. 1 ICMA’s Green Bond Principles 2018 https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ 2 https://www.bancatlan.hn /greenbondframework,Second - Party Opinion Banco Atl á ntida Green Bond 3 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytic s’ Opinion on the Banco Atlántida Green Bond Framework Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Banco Atlántida Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 201 8 . Sustainalytics highl ights the following elements of Banco Atlántida's G reen B ond F ramework :  The eligible use of proceeds category (Renewable Energy) is recognized by the Green Bond Principles , 2018 , as a project category having pos it ive environmental benefits. For additional information, please see Section 3 for Sustainalytics’ assessment of the use of proceeds o The Bank has specified that hydroelectric generati o n projects must be 2 5 MW in size or smaller to qualify as eligible. While some investors may consider small - scale hydro to be less than 15MW or 20MW, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that , in the Honduran context , well - managed projects of this size will provide positive overall environmental benefits . o Biomass generation feedstock will be limited to sources that do not deplete existing terrestrial carbon pools , protect biodiversity, and do not involve the burning of peat . The projects will produce bi oenergy from agricultural or forestry residue ( i.e. , bagasse or wood waste).  The Bank project selection and evaluation process is integrated with its regular credit approval process, whereby potentially eligible projects are selected by the relevant busine ss line and assessed through the Bank’s E nvironmental and Social Risk Analysis Process. The responsibility for determining that projects comply with the framework’s eligibility criteria rests with a dedicated green bond committee, including members of the Treasury team and the Corporate Sustainability Management team .  The net proceeds of the green bond(s) will be tracked by the Bank’s Treasury team, using internal systems , and alloca ted to financing Eligible Projects . Should divestment from one asset o ccur, the Bank will re - allocate the funds to another Eligible Project . Pending allocation, proceeds will be held in cash or cash - equivalent financial instruments, in line with the Bank’s treasury management policy.  The Bank expects to report annually on th e allocation and impact of the proceeds until all fund s are disbursed. The Bank expects to make this information available to investors in a framework that is yet to be determined but which will be either through the trustee, a secured document or website or other similar methods. Allocation reporting will include the total amount allocated to various projects , or alternatively on a consolidated project portfolio basis, while impact reporting will include, where feasible, installed generating capacity, and renewable energy generation, and annual greenhouse gas emissions avoided. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that the Banco Atlántida g reen b ond aligns to the four core components of the Green Bond Principles, 201 8 . Fo r detailed information please refer to Appendix 1 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Performance of the Issuer Contribution of framework to issuer’s sustainability strategy The Bank ’s corporate social responsibility policy is based on the core va l ues of solidarity, commitment, excellence, and professionalism, and is summarized by the phrase “ hacer negocios basados en principios éticos y apegados a la ley ”, or “do business based on ethical principles and in accordance with law” . 3 To put these practic es in action, the Bank has a Corporate Social Responsibility committee chaired by the Bank ’s CEO, which oversees social engagement with charitable organizations, corporate volunteering, educational programs, a nd arts and culture ini tiatives. To date, the B ank ha s contributed over HNL 8 million ( over USD $3 00 , 0 00) to social investments and HNL 2 million (USD $83,400) to education programs. 4 3 https://ban catlan.hn/rse/ 4 https://bancatlan.hn/rse/en - cifras/,Second - Party Opinion Banco Atl á ntida Green Bond 4 The Bank has an environmental management system based on three pillars: internal environmental management, management of environmental risk from credit activities, and involvement in green financing solutions. 5 The green financing pillar references the design and provision of credit services for investments in project s that will have positive environmental impacts, particular ly in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency. Proceeds from green bonds will support activities in this area. Although the Bank does not have quantifiable targets for its environmental and/or social activit ies , it has a demonstrated history of sustainable acti ons, as well as policies in place to promote these initiatives on an ongoing basis. In particular, the Bank has been actively involved in Honduras’ energy sector, having been involved in the financing of the country’s first privately - owned energy company in 19 94. Since this time, the Bank has supported financing for 260.34 MW of renewable energy generation , 18% of all privately - owned renewable capacity in Honduras. Given the above, Sustainalytics considers the use of proceeds to contribute to the Bank ’s environ mental and sustainability goals, and thus bel ieves that the Bank is well - positioned to issue its green bond. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects Renewable energy projects provide tangible environm ental benefits, including decreased air and water pollution and fewer greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuel generation. However, social and environmental risks may still occur; examples include land use impacts at the project site (e.g. flooding for hy dro reservoirs, installation of photovoltaic panels), alterations to river hydrology (e.g. from water diversion or sedimentation), and biodiversity impacts (e.g. impact of hydropower on fish or of wind power on birds and bats), impacts on local communities (e.g. displacement or impacts on traditional food sources), and construction worker health and safety. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Bank is well - positioned to mitigate environmental and social risks, based on the following points :  The Enviro nmental Policy of the B ank specifies that not only will it comply with all relevant environmental regulations, but that it will also consider environmental and social criteria in risk analysis and support investments with strong practices in these areas. A s a subset of the Environmental Policy, the Green Credit Program provides unique investment solutions for projects classified as green . 6 T he eligibility criteria of the Banco Atlántida G reen Bond F ramework align s well with this initiative.  The Bank has an internal Environmental a nd Social Risk Analysis Process, which includes an exclusion list, reporting, project visits, and ongoing monitoring throughout the term of any loans. The g reen b ond c ommittee will ensure compliance with stated proce dures.  All selected projects must comply with the International Finance Corporation ’s Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability. 7  By placing a limit on the size of hydroelectric projects, some of the risks are mitigated, as larger projects generally have more significant impacts, both environmentally and socially. Sustainalytics recognizes that some hydroelectric developments have deleterious environmental impacts. In particular, non - run - of - river (i.e. , storage hydro) facilities in tropical climates may trigger significant carbon emissions from newly - flooded artificial reservoirs. By limiting hydro projects to 25MW in size, the Bank has taken steps to mitigate this risk. Additionally, Sustainalytics enco urages Banco Atlántida to consider factors such as reservoir size and life - cycle environmental impacts, as well as social impacts and community consultations, when making decisions on the financing of hydro generation. Given the Bank ’s risk management pro cesses, history of support for environmental projects, and lack of involvement in significant controversies , Sustainalytics considers the Bank to be well - positioned to mitigate the potential environmental and social risks related to the projects funded by the green bond proceeds. 5 http://www.bancoatlantida.com.sv/banca - de - personas/gestion - medio - ambiental/nuestros - estandares.php 6 Eligible categories of the Bank’s Green Credit Program include renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean production, wastewater management and treatment, sustainable agriculture, sustainable forestry, tourism, transport and green buildings. 7 https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/c8f524004a73daeca09afdf998895a12/IFC_Performance_Standards.pdf?MOD=AJPERES,Second - Party Opinion Banco Atl á ntida Green Bond 5 Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds The eligible use of pro ceeds category ( R enewable E nergy) is unequivocally recognized as impactful by the G reen B ond P rinciples , 2018 . Renewable Energy and Climate Change in Honduras Honduras generates approximately 56% of its electricity from fossil fuel sources 8 (coal, gas, & oil), 32% from hydropower, 9 and 11% from non - hydro renewables 10 (wind, solar, biomass). O ver the last 15 years, Honduras has increased its access to electricity rate from 63% to 88%, 11 and is now at the worldwide average for this metric . H owever, electricity consumption per capita in Honduras remains at approximately one fifth of the global rate, indicative of an electricity supply that is intermittent, un reliable , or unaffordable. When compared to the other countries of the Central American Integration System , 12 Honduran residential energy prices are slightly above average. 13 Due to geographic and infrastructural factors, Honduras is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Climate - linked natural disasters such as hurricanes, storms, floods, droughts, and landslides, are projected to increase as a result of climate change. Specifically, most models project temperature increases and a reduction in ov erall rainfall with more intense drought periods, coupled with more frequent extreme rainfall events. 14 As a signatory to the Paris Agreement, Honduras has submitted a nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC, committing to a 15% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to the business - as - usual scenario. Additional goals include reforestation of one million hectares and a 39% reduction in firewood use as a fuel source. 15 In May 2018, Honduras formalized its first action plan, or Ho ja de Ruta , identifying 5 priority areas and 21 activities to achieve these goals. 16 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the expansion o f renewable energy projects will support achieving the greenhouse gas targets of the Paris commitments, and that expa nsion of Honduras’ electrical supply will enable reductions in firewood usage , while specifying that only sustainably sourced biomass is eligible will contribute to afforestation goals. Furthermore, investment in the renewable energy sector will result in more resilient and reliable infrastructure, supporting the social and economic development of the country, in particular in rural area s . Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an a genda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. This green bond advances the following SDG goals and targets: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Renewable Energy 7. Affordable and Clean Energy 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix Conclusion The Bank has developed the Banco Atlántida Green Bond Framework, under which it intends to issue green bonds . Proceeds of the bonds will be used to finance renewable energy projects, specifi cally wind, solar, small 8 https://data. worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.FOSL.ZS?locations=HN 9 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.HYRO.ZS?locations=HN 10 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.RNWX.ZS?locations=HN 11 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=HN - 1W&year_high_desc=false 12 Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Belize, and the Dominican Republic. 13 https://repositorio.cepal.org/bitstream/handle/11362/42720/1/S1701275_es.pdf 14 https://www.climatelinks.org/sites/default/files/asset/document/2017_USAID%20ATLAS_Climate%20Change%20Risk%20Profile_Honduras .pdf 15 http://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/PublishedD ocuments/Honduras%20First/Honduras%20INDC_esp.pdf 16 http://ndcpartnership.org/news/honduras - releases - first - ndc - partnership - plan - climate - action,Second - Party Opinion Banco Atl á ntida Green Bond 6 hydro, and sustainable biomass projects. This category is recognized as having positive environmental impacts. Sustainalytics has reviewed the Banco Atlántida Green Bond Framework with respect to its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018. The Bank’s use of proceeds criteria and commitments for project selections, management of proceeds, and reporting are in line with market practice. By supporting the development of renewable energy resources in Honduras, the green bonds wi ll contribute to the decarbonizaton of the Central American electrical system and to meeting national climate goals. Overall, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Banco Atlántida Green Bond Framework is credible, transparent, and aligned with the fo ur core components of the Green Bond Principles, 2018, and that the Bank is well - positioned to issue green bonds .,Second - Party Opinion Banco Atl á ntida Green Bond 7 Appendices Appendix 1 : Green Bond / Green Bond Programme - External Review Form Section 1.
