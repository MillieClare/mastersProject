C O M / E S G 3 o f 2 6 Overall Evaluation of the Green Bond Programme Deutsche Hypothekenbank (Deutsche Hypo) commissioned ISS ESG to assist with its Green Bond Programme by assessing th ree core elements to determine the sustainability quality of the Bond: 1. Deutsche Hypo ’s Green Bond framework – benchmarked against the International Capital Market Association's ( ICMA ) Green Bond Principles (GB Ps ). 2. The asset p ool – whether the projects aligned with ISS ESG ’s issue - specific key performance indicators (KPIs) (See Annex 3 ). 3. Deutsche Hypo ’s sustainability performance, according to the ISS ESG C orporate R ating. ISS ESG ASSESSMENT SUMMARY 1 The ISS ESG ’s present evaluation will remain valid until any modification of the Green Bond Framework or addition of new assets into the asset pool by the issuer and as long as the Corporate Rating does not change (last modification on the 27.04.2020). The controversy check of the underlying assets has been conducted on the 10.08.2020. 2 Rank relative to industry group. 1 indicates a high relative ESG performance, while 10 indicates a low relative ESG performance. SPO SECTION SUMMARY EVALUATION 1 Part 1: Performance against GBPs The issuer has defined a formal concept for its Green Bonds regarding use of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the ICMA GBPs. Positive Part 2: Sustainability quality of the asset pool The overall sustainability quality of the asset pool in terms of sustainability benefit s, risk avoidance and minimisation is good based upon the ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs. The Green Bond KPIs contain a clear description of eligible asset categories which include green buildings . The use of proceed category has a significant contribution to SDG 11 ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’. The environmental and social risks associated with the projects have been well managed. Positive Part 3: Issuer sustainability performance The issuer itself shows a good s ustainability performance and has been given a rating of “ B - “ , which classifies it as ‘Prime’ by the methodology of the ISS ESG Corporate Rating. The issuer improved its sustainability performance and hence its ISS ESG Corporate Rating by one grade from “ C+ ” in 2019 to “ B - “ in 2020. It is rated 6 th out of 126 companie s within its sector as of 2 4 .0 8 .20 20 . This equates to a high relative performance, with a Decile Rank 2 of 1 .

C O M / E S G 4 o f 2 6 Contribution of the Green Bo nd Programme to the UN SDGs Based on the assessment of the sustainability quality of the green bond asset pool and using a proprietary methodology, ISS ESG assessed the contribution of the Deutsche Hypo ’s green bond programme to the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations (UN SDGs). This assessment is displa yed on 5 - point scale (see Annex 3 for methodology): Significant Obstruction Limited Obstruction No Net Impact Limited Contribution Significant Contribution Each of the bond’ s Use of Proceeds categories has been assessed for its contribution to, or obstruction of, the SDGs: USE OF PROCEEDS CONTRIBUTION OR OBST RUCTION SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPM ENT GOALS Green Buildings with certificates 3 Significant Contribution Green Buildings Limited Contribution The issuer’s green bond programme significantly contributes to the SDGs 11 thanks to its Use of Proceeds categories promoting sustainable buildings. 3 33 out of 189 building projects, accounting for 42% of the asset pool, achieved good scores in green building certificates, i .e. minimum BREEAM “Very Good”, LEED “Gold”, DGNB “Gold”, or HQE “Performant”.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 5 o f 2 6 ISS ESG SPO ASSESSMENT PART I : GREEN BOND PRINCIPLES 1. Use of Proceeds The funds raised through the issue of Green Bonds are used exclusively to finance energy - efficient real estate. The proceeds can be used to finance Green Buildings both in new business and in existing business. Financing is geared towards the construction, project development, acquisition or energy - efficient renovation of buildings. The exact use of the proceeds is defined in the final terms of the respective bond issue. The total asset pool for this bond comprises EUR 2 . 713 . 556 . 831 . Details regarding the projects included in the asset pool, per 3 1 .07.20 20 , are listed in a table in Annex 2. Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Use of Proceeds description provided by Deutsche Hypo’s Green Bond Framework as aligned with the Green Bond Principles. Moreover, t he sustainability objectives of the issuance are in line with the sustainability strategy of the issuer. 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection The energy efficiency of a property to be financed, and therefore its suitability as an asset for a Green Bond, is evaluated in a multi - stage process. The suitab ility of a financing for a Green Bond issue and the related features, such as quantified energy efficiency, are recorded and managed in the Bank’s portfolio management system. The employees in the lending department (Credit Management) record all the neces sary data (such as energy passes, certificates, etc.) of the financing in the Bank’s IT systems. On the basis of defined criteria, using the four eyes principle, Treasury will then review whether the financed real estate is suitable for inclusion in the re al estate portfolio for a Green Bond issue. The applicable criteria are determined by a Green Building Commission which is comprised of members of the sustainability circle that supports the sustainability management team in its tasks. The Green Building Commission defines the Green Bond Minimum Sta ndards (short: GBMS) and ensures in its regular meetings that the minimum standards required in the target markets are at least complied with. An asset is categorised as a Green Building if the applicable GBMS are fulfilled at the time of inclusion of the financing in the Green Bond portfolio. The currently applicable GBMS are as follows: Germany Energy pass with a maximum final energy demand or consumption (heat) in kWh/(m²*a) by main asset class: ▪ 60 kWh/(m²*a) for residential properties ▪ 30 kWh/(m²*a) for logistics buildings ▪ 70 kWh/(m²*a) for retail buildings (shopping malls, department stores),S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 6 o f 2 6 ▪ 95 kWh/(m²*a) for other retail buildings ▪ 95 kWh/(m²*a) for hotel buildings (up to 3 star hotels) ▪ 105 kWh/(m²*a) for hotel buildings (4 to 5 star hotels) ▪ 110 kWh/(m² *a) for production and storage buildings (with heating) ▪ 110 kWh/(m²*a) for office buildings without air conditioning ▪ 135 kWh/(m²*a) for office buildings with air conditioning Foreign countries In its foreign markets, Deutsche Hypo is already following the proposals of the Technical Expert Group (TEG). The main type of use of a residential or commercial building must be assigned to the top 15% of the national building stock. The identification is based on the primary energy demand. The necessary data, inclu ding the average primary energy demand and the country - specific CO 2 intensity, is provided by Drees & Sommer engineering experts. Drees & Sommer will update this data on a regular basis. This will bring the selection criteria of the Green Bond Framework in line with current market standards. In all target markets, the primary energy demand or consumption (warmth) should be used for valuation if the use of renewable energy reduces the primary energy demand or consumption to below the final energy figure. Fur thermore, it is possible to identify a Green Building in all target markets with help of the following sustainability certificates: ▪ LEED Gold or above ▪ BREEAM Very Good or above ▪ DGNB Gold or above ▪ HQE Performant A Green Building - classification without an en ergy performance certificate or sustainability certificate is possible, too: ▪ For project developments, if the aspired energy demand or sustainability specification will be in line with the current Green Bond M inimum S tandards. ▪ For financed buildings without an energy performance certificate or sustainability certificate a detailed statement with an energy demand calculation by a real estate valuer is necessary. Deutsche Hypo's real estate customers are asked to submit a new valid document before the energy performance certificate or sustainability certificate will expire. With the expiration of valid documents, a moratorium of one (Green Buildings identified by an energy performance certificate) respectively three years (Green Buildings identified by a sustainability certificate) exists. This gives real estate customers flexibility in generating new valid documents. Furthermore, it limits the reduction of Deutsche Hypo’s own funding potential.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 7 o f 2 6 In addition, real estate belonging to customers from busine ss areas considered to be controversial may not be financed. This criterion is also a strict additional condition of Deutsche Hypo’s business strategy and is embedded in Deutsche Hypo’s sustainability programme ( www.deutsche - hypo.de ). An additional condition for the use of Green Buildings is that the financed real estate is only leased to uncontroversial main tenants. A main tenant contributes more than 10% to the rental incomes. The property will be excluded from the portfolio of suitable Green Buildings should it become known that a main tenant operates in a controversial business 4 . Opinion: ISS ESG considers the described Process for Project Evaluation and Selection provided by Deutsche Hypo as complete, exhaust ive and aligned with the Green Bond Principles . The process to determine that projects fit within the defined categories is well structured, responsibilities are clearly defined an d various stakeholders (e.g. the credit management and the green building co mmission) are involved in the process. Moreover, Deutsche Hypo excludes c ontroversial business practices. 3. Management of Proceeds The suitability of green assets in the portfolio for Green Bond issues is reviewed by Treasury employees on a regular basis an d flagged in Deutsche Hypo’s portfolio system. Unsuitable financings and the underlying assets are replaced by new financings or assets. A financing and its underlying assets are considered unsuitable if it becomes known that a main tenant is involved in a n area of business that is considered to be controversial or if the energy pass or sustainability certificate expires. Deutsche Hypo has set itself the requirement that the real estate suitable for a Green Bond issue must at least correspond to the volume of the green bond that has been issued or is to be issued. If it is not possible to directly use the proceeds from Gree n Bonds to finance energy - efficient real estate in accordance with this framework, they must be immediately invested with a credit institution with a sufficiently positive rating granted by a recognised sustainability rating agency (e.g. ISS ESG with at le ast Prime Status) on an interim basis. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the Management of Proceeds description provided by Deutsche Hypo ́s Green Bond Framework is aligned with the Green Bond Principles . Moreover, types of temporary investment instruments for un allocated proceeds are disclosed and back - up options are subject to sustainable criteria. 4. Reporting Each year, Deutsche Hypo publishes a Green Bond report on its website (www.deutsche - hypo.de). The report contains the following information: ▪ Current volume of the Green Building portfolio ▪ CO 2 reduction of all Green Buildings compared to the relevant average (including the computation) 4 Co ntroversial business segments are defined in Deutsche Hypo’s “Guidelines for sustainable real estate finance”. For a detailed list of all controversial business segments please take a look at the chapter “Sustainability at Deutsche Hypo” in Deutsche Hypo’s current Sustainability report.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 8 o f 2 6 ▪ Characterisation of the Green Buildings according to property certifications, location, sustainability aspects, etc. Deutsche Hypo publishes this data on an aggregated basis. This ensures that the Bank lives up to the requirements of its customers and the Data Protection Act. In addition, Deutsche Hypo reports on outstanding bonds and their volumes on a regular basis and publish es the information on its website. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the reporting proposed by Deutsche Hypo is aligned with the Green Bond Principles and that reporting i ndicators are already well defined . However, no clear indication is given concerning the du ration of the reporting. External review Deutsche Hypo assigns an independent provider to review the implementation of the Green Bond principles and the sustainability of the Bank’s overall Green Bond programme. This second - party opinion is posted on Deutsche Hypo’s website (www.deutsche - hypo.de), and the task is given to an independent sustainability rating agency.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 9 o f 2 6 PART II : S USTAINABILITY QUALITY OF THE ASSET POOL Green buildings As a Use of Proceeds category, green buildings with certificates (e.g. BREEAM, LEED) have a significant contribution while green buildings in general have a limited contribution to the SDG 11 “Sustainable cities and communities” . The table below presents the findings of an ISS ESG assessment of the assets (re - ) f inanced against KPIs and the association with SDGs based on a mapping methodology.

C O M / E S G 1 1 o f 2 6 PART III: ASSESSMENT OF DEUTSCHE HYPO ’S ESG PERFORMANCE The ISS ESG Corporate Rating provides a rating and then designates a company as ‘Prime 6 ’ or ‘Not Prime’ based on its performance on basic ESG requirements . It is also assigned a Decile Rank, indicating this relative industry group performance, with 1 indicating a high relative ESG performance, and 10 a low relative ESG performance. C O M P A N Y D E U T S C H E H Y P O T H E K E N B A N K S T A T U S P R I M E R a t i n g B - D E C I L E R A N K 1 This means that the company performed well in terms of sustainability, both compared against others in the industry and in terms of the industry - specific requireme nts defined by ISS ESG . In ISS ESG ’s view, the securities issued by the company therefore all meet the basic requirements for sustainable investments. As of 2 4 .08.2020 , this rating places Deutsche Hypo 6 th out of 126 companies rated by ISS ESG in the Financials/Mortgage & Public sector. Deutsche Hypo improved its sustainability performance and hence its rating by one grade from “C - “ in 2019 to “B - “ in 2020. Key Challenges facing companies in term s of sustainability management in this sector are: ▪ Sustainability impacts of lending and other financial services/products ▪ Statutory ESG - standards linked to the geographical allocation of the le nding portfolio ▪ Customer and product responsibility ▪ Employee relations and work environment In all four key issues, Deutsche Hypo rates ab ove the average for the sector. A very significant outperformance was achieved in “ Sustainability impacts of lending a nd other financial services/products ” , “Customer and product responsivity” and “Employee relations and work environment”. Details on the rating of the issuer can be found in Annex 1 . 6 Prime is only awarded to the top sector performers, often less than 10% of companies within the respective sector.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

The company issues green bonds and uses funds to finance green buildings, some of which are certified to standards such as LEED and DNGB standard. While Deutsche Hypo is seemingly increasing its exposure towards green buildings, they do not make up the company's main business yet. Deutsche Hypothekenbank's (Deutsche Hypo) covered pool claims are primarily located in countries with fairly good environmental and social minimum standards, primarily in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France. Although the environmental and social risk profile from its lending portfolio appears to be rather uncritical, Deutsche Hypo shows rather minimal efforts to minimise the impact of loan origination. The institute applies some general regulations concerning human and labour rights, and excludes financing of banned and controversial weapons. Though not strict, the company has implemented some guidelines concerning typical sustainability issues of the real estate sector, such as energy efficiency, emissions-intensity, construction materials and access to public transport. Customer and product responsibility is addressed through a comprehensive strategy on marketing as well as through some suitable procedures for treating clients with debt repayment problems fairly. Deutsche Hypo's employees enjoy well-developed work-life balance and adequate health and safety structures. Ethics risks are adequately managed via a code of conduct, which covers most important topics, such as corruption, conflict of interests, insider dealings, and money laundering in detail, and is underpinned by suitable measures, such as compliance training and a reasonable whistleblower mechanism. Deutsche Hypothekenbank (Deutsche Hypo) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Norddeutsche Landesbank, ultimately owned by the State of Lower Saxony, Germany. The chair of the supervisory board (Thomas Bürkle) is not independent as he is also the chief executive of Deutsche Hypo's parent company (as at February 4, 2020). Likewise, the majority of the remaining board members are not independent. Board committees in charge of audit, remuneration and nomination are in place but primarily consist of non-independent board members. The bank discloses figures for remuneration split-up according to fixed amounts and variable short and long-term performance components, but only for the executive team as a whole. A respective board committee dedicated to sustainability appears to be missing. While sustainability performance objectives are integrated into executive management's remuneration, the objectives themselves remain unclear. The bank's compliance framework is comprehensive: The bank's code of conduct comprises most of the relevant compliance topics in detail. This includes stipulations on corruption, insider dealing, conflict of interests, gifts and favours, as well as money laundering. Employee are required to give formal acknowledgment to the code and regular training as well as reporting channels, anonymous and confidential, if needed, are designed to additionally ensure compliance. ESG Corporate Rating / Last Modification: 2020-04-27 Page 2 of 33 © ISS ESG,Deutsche Hypothekenbank (Actien-Gesellschaft) Methodology - Overview The ESG Corporate Rating methodology was originally developed by Institutional Shareholder Services Germany (formerly oekom research) and has been consistently updated for more than 25 years. ESG Corporate Rating - The ESG Corporate Rating universe, which is currently expanding from more than 8,000 corporate issuers to a targeted 10,000 issuers in 2020, covers important national and international indices as well as additional companies from sectors with direct links to sustainability and the most important bond issuers that are not publicly listed companies. The assessment of a company's social & governance and environmental performance is based on approximately 100 environmental, social and governance indicators per sector, selected from a pool of 800+ proprietary indicators. All indicators are evaluated independently based on clearly defined performance expectations and the results are aggregated, taking into account each indicator’s and each topic’s materiality-oriented weight, to yield an overall score (rating). If no relevant or up-to-date company information with regard to a certain indicator is available, and no assumptions can be made based on predefined standards and expertise, e.g. known and already classified country standards, the indicator is assessed with a D-. In order to obtain a comprehensive and balanced picture of each company, our analysts assess relevant information reported or directly provided by the company as well as information from reputable independent sources. In addition, our analysts actively seek a dialogue with the assessed companies during the rating process and companies are regularly given the opportunity to comment on the results and provide additional information. Analyst Opinion - Qualitative summary and explanation of the central rating results in three dimensions: (1) Opportunities - assessment of the quality and the current and future share of sales of a company’s products and services, which positively or negatively contribute to the management of principal sustainability challenges. (2) Risks - summary assessment of how proactively and successfully the company addresses specific sustainability challenges found in its business activity and value chain, thus reducing its individual risks, in particular regarding its sector’s key issues. (3) Governance - overview of the company’s governance structures and measures as well as of the quality and efficacy of policies regarding its ethical business conduct. Controversial Business Practices - The assessment of companies' sustainability performance in the ESG Corporate Rating is informed by a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of companies' ability to prevent and mitigate ESG controversies. ISS ESG conducts research and analysis on corporate involvement in verified or alleged failures to respect recognized standards for responsible business conduct through Norm- Based Research . Norm-Based Research is based on authoritative standards for responsible business conduct such as the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights and the Sustainable Development Goals. As a stress-test of corporate disclosure, Norm-Based Research assesses the following: - Companies' ability to address grievances and remediate negative impacts - Degree of verification of allegations and claims - Severity of impact on people and the environment, and systematic or systemic nature of malpractices Severity of impact is categorized as Potential, Moderate, Severe, Very severe. This informs the ESG Corporate Rating. Decile Rank - The Decile Rank indicates in which decile (tenth part of total) the individual Corporate Rating ranks within its industry from 1 (best – company’s rating is in the first decile within its industry) to 10 (lowest – company’s rating is in the tenth decile within its industry). The Decile Rank is determined based on the underlying numerical score of the rating. If the total number of companies within an industry cannot be evenly divided by ten, the surplus company ratings are distributed from the top (1 decile) to the bottom. If there are Corporate Ratings with identical absolute scores that span a division in decile ranks, all ratings with an equal decile score are classified in the higher decile, resulting in a smaller number of Corporate Ratings in the decile below.

Key Issue Performance - Overview of the company's performance with regard to the key social and environmental issues in the industry, compared to the industry average. Performance Score - The ESG Performance Score allows for cross-industry comparisons using a standardized best-in-class threshold that is valid across all industries. It is the numerical representation of the alphabetic ratings (D- to A+) on a scale of 0 to 100 with 50 representing the prime threshold. All companies with values greater than 50 are Prime, while companies with values less than 50 are Not Prime. As a result, intervals are of varying size depending on the original industry-specific prime thresholds. Rating History - Development of the company's rating over time and comparison to the average rating in the industry. Rating Scale - Companies are rated on a twelve-point scale from A+ to D-: A+: the company shows excellent performance. D-: the company shows poor performance (or fails to demonstrate any commitment to appropriately address the topic). Overview of the range of scores achieved in the industry (light blue) and indication of the grade of the company evaluated in this report (dark blue). Distribution of Ratings - Overview of the distribution of the ratings of all companies from the respective industry that are included in the ESG Corporate Rating universe (company portrayed in this report: dark blue). Sources of Information - A selection of sources used for this report is illustrated in the annex. Status & Prime Threshold - Companies are categorized as Prime if they achieve/exceed the sustainability performance requirements (Prime threshold) defined by ISS ESG for a specific industry (absolute best-in-class approach) in the ESG Corporate Rating. Prime companies are sustainability leaders in their industry and are better positioned to cope with material ESG challenges and risks, as well as to seize opportunities, than their Not Prime peers. The financial materiality of the Prime Status has been confirmed by performance studies, showing a continuous outperformance of the Prime portfolio when compared to conventional indices over more than 14 years. Transparency Level - The Transparency Level indicates the company’s materiality-adjusted disclosure level regarding the environmental and social performance indicators defined in the ESG Corporate Rating. It takes into consideration whether the company has disclosed relevant information regarding a specific indicator, either in its public ESG disclosures or as part of the rating feedback process, as well as the indicator’s materiality reflected in its absolute weight in the rating. The calculated percentage is classified in five transparency levels following the scale below. 0% - < 20%: very low 20% - < 40%: low 40% - < 60%: medium 60% - < 80%: high 80% - 100%: very high For example, if a company discloses information for indicators with a cumulated absolute weight in the rating of 23 percent, then its Transparency Level is “low”. A company’s failure to disclose, or lack of transparency, will impact a company’s ESG performance rating negatively. Industry Classification - The social and environmental impacts of industries differ. Therefore, based on its relevance, each industry analyzed is classified in a Sustainability Matrix. Depending on this classification, the two dimensions of the ESG Corporate Rating, the Social Rating and the Environmental Rating, are weighted and the sector- specific minimum requirements for the ISS ESG Prime Status (Prime threshold) are defined (absolute best-in-class approach).

C O M / E S G 2 5 o f 2 6 ANNEX 3 : Methodology ISS ESG Green Bon d KPIs The ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs serves as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality – i.e. the social and environmental added value – of the use of proceeds of Deutsche Hypo’s Green Bond . It comprises firstly the definition of the use of proceeds category offering added social and/or environmental value, and secondly the specific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the assets can be clearly identified and described. The sustainability criteria are co mplemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measurement of the sustainability performance of the assets and which can also be used for reporting. To review the KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Federico Pezzolato (details below ) who wi ll send them directly to you. Asset evaluation methodology ISS ESG evaluates whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eligible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bond KPIs . All percentages refer to the amount of assets within one category (e.g. wind power). Additionally, the assessment “no or limited information is available” represented by a red circle, either indicates that no information was made available to ISS ESG or that the information provided did not fulfil the requi rements of the ISS ESG Green Bon d KPIs . ISS ESG requires a minimum of 50% of the asset pool to positively qualify against the KPIs, represented by a green tick. The evaluation was carried out using information and documents provided to ISS ESG on a confide ntial basis by Deutsche Hypo (e.g . Due Diligence Reports). Further, national legislation and standards, depending on the asset location, were drawn on to complement the information provided by the issuer. Assessment of the contribution and association to t he SDG The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed in September 2015 by the United Nations and provide a benchmark for key opportunities and challenges toward a more sustainable future . Using a proprietary method, ISS ESG identifies the extent to which Deutsche Hypo ’s Green Bond contributes to related SDGs and has a positive association with their respective sub - targets .,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 2 6 o f 2 6 About ISS ESG SPO ISS ESG is one of the world’s leading rating agencies in the field of sustainable investment. The agency analyses companies and countries regarding their environmental and social performance. As part of our Sustainable ( Green & Social) Bo nd Services, we provide support for companies and institutions issuing sustainable bonds, advise t hem on the selection of categories of projects to be financed and help them to define ambitious criteria. We assess alignment with external principles (e.g. the ICMA Green / Social Bond Principles ), analyse the sustainability quality of the assets and rev iew the sustainability performance of the issuer themselves. Following these three steps, we draw up an independent SPO so that investors are as well informed as possible about the quality of the bond / loan from a sustainability perspective .
