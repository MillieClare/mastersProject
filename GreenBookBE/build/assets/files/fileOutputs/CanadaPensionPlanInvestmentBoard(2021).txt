‘Second Opinion’ on CPP Investments ’ Green Bond Framework 1 CPP Investments Green Bond Second Opinion October 14 , 2021 CPP Investments manages the C anada Pension Plan (CPP) Fund on behalf of the CPP’s 20 million Canadian contributors and beneficiaries. CPP Investments remains independent of the CPP, operates at arm’s length from federal and provincial governments and is guided by an independent Board of Directors. As of Marc h 31 , 202 1 , CPP Investments manages almost CAD 49 7 billion in investment assets . Under this framework, t he proceeds of CPP Investments’ green bonds are expected to be predominantly used to make e q uity and debt investments to finance and/or refinance green builings and renewable (solar and wind) energy projects . While the framework indicated that energy efficiency and low carbon/clean transportation projects will be eligible , p revious green bond issuances for CPP Investments have been wholly allocated to green buildings and renewable energy investments. CPP Investments has excluded any direct investments in fossil fuels or power generated by fossil fuels. Moreover, i nvestees must have all their revenues derived from eligible green assets in order to be eligible for investment s . Still, even with a policy of active ownership, it can be difficult to control the end - use of equity investments. Currently, CPP Investments may indirectly support supply chains that are fossil - fuel in tensive or ma y support the use of fossil - fuel powered equipment . B y not undertaking life cycle analyses of investments, their investments could be exposed to lock - in and/or rebound effects. CPP Investments has a robust selection process , governance system and reporting stucture , and has fully implemented TCFD . Its Sustainable I nvestment Committee, led by Head of Sustainable Investing, reviews all potential investments against the f ramework to assess whether an investment qualifies for addi tion to the register . I n its annual sustainable investing report , CPP Investments disclose s the details of investments made with Green Bond proceeds during the preceding 12 months. This disclosure include s a description of each green project, the share of new financing versus refinancing and, where available, metrics about the projects’ environmental impact. Based on the overall assessment of the eligible green assets under this framework, governance and transparency considerations, CPP Investments ’ green bond framework receives a CICERO Medium Green shading and a governance score of Good . The framework would be strengthened if CPP Investments use d third - party reviews for the its impact re porting, provided more details on eligible energy efficiency investments and if CPP Investments set specific goals or targets for reducing absolute GHG emission, its carbon footprint, or the carbon intensity of its portfolio. SHADES OF GREEN Based on our review, we rate the CPP I nvestments’ green bond framework CICERO Medium Green. Included in the overall shading is an assessment of the governance structure of the green bond framework. CICERO Shades of Green finds the governance procedures in CPP I nvestments’ framework to be Good .

This second opinion remains relevant to all green bonds and/or loans issued under this framework for the duration of three years from publication of this second opinion , as long as the framework remains unchanged. Any amendments or updates to the framework require a revised s econd o pinion . CICERO Green encourages the client to make this s econd o pinion publicly available. If any part of the s econd o pinion is quoted, the full report must be made available. The second opinion is based on a review of the framework and documentation of the client’s policies and processes , a s well as information gathered during meetings, teleconferences and email correspondence . Expressing concerns with ‘ S hades of G reen’ CICERO Green s econd o pinions are graded dark green, medium green or light green, reflecting a broad, qualitative review of the cli mate and environmental risks and ambitions. The shading methodology aims to provide transparency to investors that seek to understand and act upon potential exposure to climate risks and impacts. Investments in all shades of green projects are necessary in order to successfully implement the ambition of the Paris agreement. The shades are intended to communicate the following: Sound governance and transparency processes facilitate delivery of the client’s climate and environmental ambitions laid out in t he framework. Hence, key governance aspects that can influence the implementation of the green bond are carefully considered and reflected in the overall shading. CICERO Green considers four factors in its review of the client’s governance processes: 1) th e policies and goals of relevance to the green bond framework; 2) the selection process used to identify and approve eligible projects under the framework, 3) the management of proceeds and 4) the reporting on the projects to investors. Based on these fact ors, we assign an overall governance grade: Fair, Good or Excellent. Please note this is not a substitute for a full evaluation of the governance of the issuing institution, and does not cover , e.g. , corruption.,‘Second Opinion’ on CPP Invest ments ’ Green Bond Framework 4 2 Brief d escri ption of CPP Investments ’ g ree n b ond f ramework and related policies CPP Investments, former ly Canada Pension Plan Investment Board , is a professional investment management organization that invests the funds of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) not currently needed to pay pension, disability and survivor benefits. CPP Investments manages the CPP Fund on behalf of the CPP’s 20 million Canadian contributors and beneficiaries . CPP Investments remains independent of the CPP , operate s at arm’s length from federal and provincial governments and is guided by an independent Board of Directors. As of March 3 1 , 20 2 1 , CPP Investments manages almost CAD 497 0 billion in investment assets while investments outside of Canada amount to 8 4 . 3 % of its total assets under management . As a pension fund investment manager, CPP Investments has a legislative objective to invest its assets with a view to maximizing retur ns without undue risk of loss and managing the CPP Fund in the best interests of CPP contributors and beneficiaries. This mandate implies a long - term i nvestment horizon and facilitates CPP Investments’ increasing focus on investment opportunities in sustai nable infrastructure projects and companies. CPP Investments has supported this ambition by issuing six green bonds to this poin t. According to its Report on Sustainable Investing 2020, CPP Investments used the proceeds of thes e bonds to invest in renewabl e energy companies and green buildings. As of 2020, CP P Investment s ’ renewable energy portfolio represented 1.5% of total investments. As of March 31, 202 1 , i n total, almost 79% of CPP Investments’ portfolio is allocated to developed markets with the other 21% in eme rging markets. W hile 7 9 . 0 % of CPP Investments ’ assets are in its equity and credit investing programs 1 , 8. 6 % is invested in real estate, 8. 2 % in infrastructure, 2.1% in power and renewables, and 2.0 % in energy and resources. Environmental Strategies and Policies CPP Investments’ climate change disclosure has evolved over the past four years. In 2018 CPP Investments developed an in - house methodology to estimate the metrics and published the first carbon footprint of its public equities portfolio which included metrics on total carbon emissions and carbon intensity. In 2019, it provided a more comprehensive metric that included both their public and private investments. For 2020, it further enhanced the metrics by estimating government issued securities, cash and all derivatives. The carbon footprint metrics now cover all CPP Investments’ holdings , but do not account for its own Scope 1 and 2 emissions 2 . CPP Investments reported that, in 2020, its public and private assets, excluding cash and non - equity derivatives, portfolio weighted average carbon intensity reduced by approximately 23%. The reduction was primarily attributed to reduced carbon emissions and/or improved carbon efficiencies in the portfolio companies they invest. While providing year - on - year data, CPP Investments does not set specific goals or targets for reducing absolute GHG emission, its carbon footprint, or the carbon intensity of its portfolio. In fact, it notes that the absolute GHG emissions associated with its portfolio will typically rise as assets under management grow. CPP Investments has an est ablished Policy on Sustainable Investing that serves as the overarching policy on how CPP Investments approaches environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. CPP Investments evaluates and incorporates risks and opportunities associated with potenti ally material ESG factors into its investment 1 This 76% includes investments through its Balancing Program s a nd Financing , Active Public Programs, Private Credit, and Private Equity programs. Note that these programs are diversified across sectors. 2 From 2019 to 2020, CPP Investments’ carbon footprint of its public and private assets declined from 107 tCO 2 e/$ million invested to 104 tCO 2 e/$ million invested .,‘Second Opinion’ on CPP Invest ments ’ Green Bond Framework 5 decision - making process and its asset management activities. The Sustainable Investment team at CPP Investments works with investment and asset management teams on all major transactions across investment depar tments to ensure CPP Investments has an integrated approach to incorporating ESG considerations into its decision - making processes. Since 2008, C P P Investments annually issues a Sustainable Investing Report in which it also publishes the estimated impact s of the investments made using previous green bond proceeds . CPP Investments names “climate change” and “water” as two of their five areas of engagement with companies in which they have made investments . CPP Investments does not follow a divestment appro ach, neither do they use ESG criteria to exclude entire investment categories. CPP Investments confirmed that specific investments are excluded from consideration if the ESG criteria warrant such a stance. In addition, the Head of Sustainable Investing is a member of CPP Investments’ Active Equities investment committee. CPP Investments states that it would prefer to actively engage with and attempt to influence companies when it disagrees with a position taken by management or a board of directors of its a ctive holdings. According to CPP Investments, its only formal exclusion criteri on is of companies which are not in compliance with Canada’s Anti - Personnel Mine Convention Implementation Act or Prohibiting Cluster Munitions Act, or that would not comply if they operated in Canada. CPP Investments has fully adopt ed the TCFD’s recommendations . In its 2020 annual report, CPP Investments outlined how it will implement the governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets pillars in the TCFD recommendations. As well , in its 2020 Sustainable Investing Report , it outlined how it continued to refine a c l imate - related scenario analysis fram ework to identify climate - related risks and opportunities and assess the impact and resilience of its investments . Prior to this, in 2019, CPP Investments engaged third - party service providers to explore options to quantify the potential financial impact o f different global warming scenarios on CPP Investments’ portfolios over different time horizons. The work provided CPP Investments directional estimates that enabled it to identify portfolios or companies that may be relatively more sensitive to climate c hange transition risk and physical risk under the extreme scenarios. It also gained a better understanding of areas requiring further methodological enhancements. CPP Investments is involved in several initiatives that increase their knowledge and capacit y to integrate climate change and other environmental risks and opportunities into their investment decisions, including: • Task Force on Climate - related Financial Disclosures • G7 Investor Leadership Network (encouraging rapid adoption of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate - related Disclosures) • Private Equity Advisory Committee of the United Nations - supported Principles for Responsible Investment ( focused on ESG - related objectives and projects in private equity funds for PRI signatories ) • Sustaina bility Accounting Standards Board Investor (SASB) Advisory Group ( encourages companies to disclose financially relevant, potentially material industry - specific ESG factors in alignment with SASB’s standards ) • Hermes Equity Ownership Services (engages with companies exposed to climate change as well as water - related risks on behalf of CPP Investments and other investors) • Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP): Climate Change Program , Forests Program, and Water Program Use of proceeds The net proceeds from the green debt will be used to invest in projects in the eligible categories and in companies that derive all of the ir revenue from these categories . These eligible categories include renewable energy, green buildings , low carbon/clean transportation, and energy efficiency . The i ssuer did not know at this point how proceeds will be split between new finance and re - finance investments, geographic allocations, or between specific projects and company investments , but informed us that the SIC will continu e to assess op portunities on an,‘Second Opinion’ on CPP Invest ments ’ Green Bond Framework 6 individual basis. In its framework , CPP Investments outlines how these categories are mapped to the European Union taxonomy, but this opinion has not screened this alignment. CPP Investments expects the net proceeds to finance or re - finance the initial e ligible i nvestments, any new e ligible i nvestments approved, as well as any future commitments for those investments to the extent approved by the Sustainable Investing Committee (SIC) . Eligible Investments may include existing green investments that have been funded by CPP Investments within the 24 months preceding the date of the Green Bond issuance if approved by the SIC . The bond framework does not have a specif ied e xclusion s list bu t does indicat e that the register will not include any direct investments in fossil fuels or power generated by fossil fuels . Selection The selection process is a key governance factor to consider in CICERO Green’s assessment. CICERO Green typically looks at how climate and environmental considerations are considered when evaluating whether projects can qualify for green finance funding. The broader the project categories, the more importance CICERO Green places on the governance process. As this framework is a continuation of CPP Investments sustainable investing efforts , it previously had established a Green Bond Committee (G BC) that focused solely on the CPP Investments’ Green Bond Program. This responsibility has now shifted to the organization’s Sustainable Investing Committee (SIC) . The SIC is comprised of senior representatives from teams across the organizations and is c haired by the Managing Director, Head of Sustainable Investing. The S IC has been reconstituted to include the GBC and other legacy climate change - related committees to provide a central forum for the monitoring and guidance of issues related to ESG, includ ing climate change. Several members of the former GBC are members of the SIC. I ndividual investment teams take ESG considerations into account when making investment decisions. The S IC becomes aware of potential e ligible i nvestments through direct engagem ent with investment groups that have completed, or are looking to complete , green investments. The SIC reviews these investments against the Green Bond Framework to assess whether an investment qualif ies for addition to the Green Bond register and receipt or allocation of Green Bond proceeds . Management of proceeds CICERO Green finds the management of proceeds of CPP Investments to be in accordance with the Green Bond Principles. The net proceeds from CPP Investments’ Green Bond issuance will be deposited to CPP Investments’ general account and an amount equal to the net proceeds will be earmarked for allocation to e ligible i nvestments approved by the GBC. Eligible investments ar e added to the Green Bond Register. CPP Investments reports on the Green Bond Register in its annual sustainable investing report alongside the impacts from the green bond investments. Investments made using green bond proceeds are documented in the Green Bond Register and the value of issuance will not exceed the value of eligible investments listed in the Green Bond Register.,‘Second Opinion’ on CPP Invest ments ’ Green Bond Framework 7 Allocation of proceeds will be on a portfolio basis. According to the issuer, there will be no unallocated funds upon completion o f a Green Bond offering. The payment of principal and interest on any Green Bond issued by CPP Investments will be made from i ts general funds and will not be linked to the performance of any e ligible i nvestment. According to the issuer, CPP Investments does not intend to use external auditing or other third - party reviews for the management of proceeds. Reporting Transparency, reporting, and verification of impacts are key to enable investors to follow the implementation of green finance programs. Proced ures for reporting and disclosure of green finance investments are also vital to build confidence that green finance is contributing towards a sustainable and climate - friendly future, both among investors and in society. CPP Investments will disclose details of eligible investments made during the preceding 12 months in its annual sustainable investing report. According to the issuer, CPP Investments will include a description of each green project, the share of new financing versus refinancing and, where available, metrics about the projects’ environmental impact in the report . These details will be available on the Investor Relations section of the CPP Investments website. Green bonds that have been issued previously reported the metric tonnes of CO 2 avoided, megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable energy generation contributed annually , as well as the energy use intensity and carbon emission intensity of its green buil dings. These metrics have been scaled to align with CPP Investme nts’ share of ownership. The issuer informed us that the a llocation of proceeds will be on a portfolio basis, meaning they will be notionally allocated across the e ligible i nvestments in the Green Bond Register . The review process will include a Managemen t Attestation report to confirm th at e ligible i nvestments reside in the portfolio and validate proceeds management as declared in the green bond framework.,‘Second Opinion’ on CPP Invest ments ’ Green Bond Framework 8 3 Assessment of CPP Investments ’ g reen b ond framework and polic ies The framework and procedures fo r CPP I nvestments ’ g reen b ond investments are assessed and their strengths and weaknesses are discussed in this section. The strengths of an investment framework with respect to environmental impact are areas where it clearly supports low - carb on projects ; weaknesses are typically areas that are unclear or too general. Pitfalls are also raised in this section to note areas where CPP I nvestments should be aware of potential macro - level impacts of investment projects. Overall shading Based on the project category s hadings detailed below, and consideration of environmental ambitions and governance structure reflected in CPP I nvestments’ g reen b ond framework, we rate the framework CICERO Medium G reen. Eligible projects under the CPP Investments ’ g reen b ond f ramework At the basic level, the selection of eligible project categories is the primary mechanism to ensure that projects deliver environmental benefits. Through selection of project categories with clear environmental benefits, green b ond s aim to provide investors with certainty that their investments deliver environmental returns as well as financial returns. The Green Bonds Principles (GBP) state that the “overall environmental profile” of a proje ct should be assessed and that the selection process should be “well defined”. Category Eligible project types Green Shading and some concerns Renewable Energy • Acquisition, operation, maintenance and upgrades of wind and solar energy projects • Acquisition, operation, maintenance and upgrades of renewable energy storage projects • Acquisition, operation, maintenance and upgrades of wind energy projects • Efficiency improvements of wind and solar energy projects D ark Green • Current ly, c onsider ation of negative impacts caused by the construction of solar and wind projects on ecologically sensitive areas, biodiversity, and wildlife is left to investees during the permitting process and only taken up by issuer when monitoring investment . Direct i n tegration of these concerns into the i nvestment eligibility criteria would serve to minimize risks of a dverse impacts (deforestation, destruction of habitats etc.). • While the issuer indicated that projects will most likely be connected to the grid there is a residual risk that certain assets will,‘Second Opinion’ on CPP Invest ments ’ Green Bond Framework 9 be deployed to exclusively serve fossil fuel intensive customers . • Acco rding to the issuer, the issuer does not typi cally consider life cycle emissions in investment assessments . • The i ssuer does not have fixed criteria of emissions intensity above which a potential investment is excluded. As it invests globally, the threshold of what is considered efficient will vary and may not be ambitious. • Green Buildings • Direct investments in to buildings certified as LEED Platinum and/or their global equivalent Medium to Dark Green • The LEED certification scheme for buildings does not explicitly assess climate risks, or climate change adaptation and resilience measures. These subjects should still be considered when making investment decisions. For example, a LEED certification does not guarantee a level of energy efficiency improvements and issuer confirmed that they do not have a minimum Energy Star certification target. • Although cert ification scheme s may not take into consideration resilience measure , the issuer informed that it screens for resilience during investment process. • Issuer indicated that ‘global equivalent’ could mean application of DGNB in Germany and /or BREEAM in UK , whi ch in both cases are not exactly equivalent in their certification system as LEED. • Investments could include residential and commercial investments. CPP does not screen out emission intensive customers. • The i ssuer does not include proximity to clean trans portation or clea n transportation,‘Second Opinion’ on CPP Invest ments ’ Green Bond Framework 10 infrastructures as part of its building investment selection. Low Carbon/Clean Transportation • Investment s in construction, development, operation, acquisition and maintenance of low carbon transportation assets, including: • Electric, fuel cell and non - motorized vehicles and supporting infrastructure such as charging stations • Infrastructure and rolling stock for mass transit Not applicable to investments in conventional energy or non - renewable power generation . Light to Medium Green • The production of batteries and sourcing of raw materials can have substantial climate and environmental impact . These is sues are linked to support of electrified transportation. According to issuer, only low to zero - emission mass transit vehicles will be eligible for investment. However, the issuer has not specified any additional thresholds for its low - emission vehicles. T his bears the risk of including plug - in hybrid vehicles which could potentially feature substantial emissions. • There is the possibility of potential lock - in effects through the construction of infrastructure projects (e.g., new railways, and railway statio ns, technical buildings related to new railways tha t follow no further requirements beyond regulations.) In addition, railways could potentially be used for fossil fuel transportation. • The i ssuer disclosed that commercial vehicles such as heavy duty construction and mining equipment may be included. Energy Efficiency • Investing in technologies / infrastructure that result in increased energy - efficiency . Not applicable to investments in conventional energy or non - renewable power generation. Medium to Light Green • The i ssuer has not specified any energy thresholds to set baseline for increased efficiency. • Without life cycle analysis of investments , lock - in and rebound effects may not be identified or mitigated . • The i ssuer has excluded direct investments in fossil fuel assets. However, there could be indirect,‘Second Opinion’ on CPP Invest ments ’ Green Bond Framework 11 support of fossil fuel based infrastructure such as smart metering which are directed at end - user consumption. Where such financing is involved, efficiency i mprovements should lead to a significant reduction in fossil fuel consumption and should avoid the risk of lock - in of emissions. Table 1 . Eligible project categories Background The asset management sector plays a major role in global climate change, both in terms of absolute emissions and influence. FinanceMap is a newly launched platform, which has mapped the Paris Portfolio Alignment of the underlying real assets in 50,000 listed fund portfolios, based on the IEA - defined Beyond 2 Degrees Scenario, which provides a pathway for a 50% chance of limiting warming to 1.75 o C. 3 The report finds that significant portions of the portfolio holdings of investors globally are within climate - sensitive sectors such as the automotive, electric utilities and fossil fuel production sectors. These sectors are together worth US $8 trillion in market value, which is close to 10% of all global listed equity value. The FinanceMap further highlights that the world’s 15 largest asset management groups, which hold a total $37 tril lion in assets in all classes, or 20% of the total value of global capital markets 4 , are all deviated from the Paris Aligned targets. Subsequently, the report has mapped each sector’s level of alignment with the Paris agreement and the 1.75 - degree target. Investments in renewable power are misaligned by - 21% and electric vehicles by - 59%, indicating a need for rapid acceleration in shifting investment strategies toward these technologies. A 2019 AODP report ranking the world’s 100 largest public pension f unds based on their approach to climat e related risks and opportunities also illustrates the need for greater action on the pension fund level. 5 The assessment further finds a large gap in formal climate - risk assessment of portfolios, with only 10% of fun ds being subject to a formal investment policy that seeks alignment with the goals of the Paris agreement. Over 60% of pension funds publish little to no information on their climate responses, and more than 80% of funds do not currently undertake and do not plan to undertake TCFD - aligned reporting. Around 50% of pensions funds were found to engage with investee companies on climate issues, although this engagement is often limited to improving disclosure instead of driving action. In this context, CPP Inv estments wa s ranked 32 out of 100, placing it in the “ Learners ” category, which is the third highest level after the “Leaders” and “Challengers” category. The asset management sector must undergo a rapid acceleration in climate action in order to align t he global markets with global trajectories, through prioritizing more robust engagement with a focus on not only accelerating individual corporate transitions to low carbon technologies and activities, but also on getting companies to align their policy lo bbying with Paris targets. The finance sector has developed multiple initiatives in order to accelerate the low - carbon transition, including the Principles for Responsible Investment and the Climate Action 100+ initiative. A 2015 survey of investors showed that 36% of respondents had divested assets during the previous yea r in response to ESG factors, with a further 27% planning to monitor ESG risks more closely 6 . However, currentl y 3 https://www.sustainablefinance.ch/upload/rm/financemap - report - nov - 2019 - final - 1.pdf?_=1575638165000 4 Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIF MA), Capital Markets Fact Book, 2019. https://www.sifma.org/wp - content/uploads/2019/09/2019 - Capital - Markets - Fact - Book - SIFMA.pdf 5 https://aodproject.net/wp - content/uploads/2019/01/AODP - PensionsChangingClimate.pdf 6 Climate change: The investment perspective (ey.com),‘Second Opinion’ on CPP Invest ments ’ Green Bond Framework 12 only smaller players and only a portion of the largest asset managers are showing evidence of engaging sufficiently 7 . In order to facilitate the alignment with the Paris agreement, efforts amongst major players will need to be significantly ramped up. Governance Assessment Four aspects are studied when assessing the CPP I nvestm ents ’ governance procedures : 1) t he policies and goals of relevance to the green bond framework ; 2) the selection process used to identify eligible projects under the framework ; 3) the management of proceeds ; and 4) the reporting on the projects to investors. Based on these aspects, an overall grading is given on governance strength falling into one of three classes: Fair, Good or Excellent. Please note this is not a substitute for a full evaluation of the governance of the issuing institution, and d oes not cover , e.g. , corruption. CPP Investments has fully adopted the TCFD’s recommendations , but it does not disclose its own Scope 1 and 2 emissions . Given the size its portfolio holdings, operational e missions are assumed to be less than emissions fro m its investments on which CPP Investments reports . Since publishing its first carbon footprint metrics of its public equities in 2018, CPP Investments has gradually expanded the coverage of its reporting to other asse t classes. While providing year - on - yea r data, CPP Investments does not set specific goals or targets for reducing absolute GHG emission, its carbon footprint, or the carbon intensity of its portfolio. CPP Inves tments notes that the absolute GHG emissions associated with its portfolio will typically rise as assets under management grow. CPP Investments will also allocate proceeds to equity investments whe re all of the respective company’s activities comply with the eligibility criteria of the framework. CICERO Green encourages the issuer to furhter strengthen its active ownership policies. Individual investment teams take ESG considerations into account when making investment decisions. The Sustainable Investing Committee (SIC ), which has taken on the responsibility of the former Green Bond Committee, becomes aware of potential eligible investments through direct engagement with investment groups that have completed, or are looking to complete, green investments. Upon review, t he SIC decides whether an investment qualifies for addition to the Green Bond register and receipt or allocation of Green Bond proceeds. Having previously issued six green bonds, all of which fully allocated funds, CPP Investments has developed a clear green bond reporting section in its annual sustainable investing reports . The reporting includes descriptions of specific projects and aggregated impacts of green bond investments. To this point, CPP Investments does not use third - party reviews for its an nual impact reporting . The overall assessment of CPP I nvestments ’ go vernance structure and processes gives it a rating of Good . Strengths CPP Investments’ well - developed sustainable investing program and multi - level support within its organization provides assurance that future green bond issuances will follow a similar path as previous issuances. Its commitment to invest in green buildings that meet the highest current ra tings is ambitious. With i ndividual investment teams tak ing into account ESG considerations when making investment decisions and the evolution of the SIC , CPP Investments is well - placed to e xpand its sustainable investing program . 7 https://www.sustainablefinance.ch/upload/rm/financemap - report - nov - 2019 - final - 1.pdf?_=1575638165000,‘Second Opinion’ on CPP Invest ments ’ Green Bond Framework 13 Moreover, through its f ull adoption the TCFD’s recommendations and involvement in several international initiatives CPP Investments continues to increase its knowledge and capacity to integrate climate change and other environmental risks and opportunities into their investment decisions . Though not opined on here, the framework outlines how project categories are mapped to the EU Taxonomy Weaknesses CPP In vestments will use Green Bond proceeds to invest into private companies that deliver eligible green p rojects. CPP Investments’ screening process for eligible projects and companies is based on investment teams taking into account ESG consideration and the SIC determining if the investment is eligible for G reen B ond proceeds. Investments are only eligible for Green Bond proceeds if all its revenue are generated from activities with the eligible investment categories. Nevertheless, without critical eligibilit y thresholds for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, it is unclear whether investments meet a n ambitious sta ndard. Moreover, while the issuer highli ghted that it works with investees to move toward best practices for reducing investee carbon footprints, it remain s unclear what happens if investees do not progress ambitiously. CICERO Green encourages the issuer to clarify this in its active ownership policies. Pitfalls CPP Investments report on carbon footprint metr ics for all of its holdings, but do not account for its own Scope 1 and 2 emissions and did not indicate an intention to do so. As well, there is a lack of quantitative climate targets in the framework, as well as in CPP Investments’ overall environmental strategy and policies . I n fact, CPP Investments expects emissions to grow as its portfolio grows. While CPP Investments indicated that it screens for resilience for its green building investments, screening all projects would mitigate risk. As CPP Investments invests globally and own s investments that face a wide range of physical risks , a systematic screening criterion would demonstrate ambition on this issue . Although renewable energy projects a re considered to have positive climate mitigation impacts, there are emissions associated with the supply chain (e.g., solar panels, turbines etc.), and the construction process . The issuer indicated that life cycle considerations are not integrated into t he selection process. Life cycle assessments provide valuable information on the environmental and climate impacts of investments and can highlight areas in which CPP Investments could work with investees to reduce emissions. The framework includes a cle an transportation category which allows for investments in low carbon vehicles, incl. hybrids. While plug - in hybrids can run entirely on electricity, these vehicles nevertheless can still run on fossil fuels. In addition, by including commercial vehicles i ncl. mining vehicles, CPP could include financing of potentially emission intensive activities, such as mining and other heavy industrial operations. Despite the framework indicat ing that there will be no direct investments in fossil fuels or power generated by fossil fuels , as CPP Investments invests in companies, it remains possible that investee s will own or purchase fossil - fuel powered inputs ( e.g., vehicles ) . In addition, according to the issuer, renewable energy projects will most likely be connected to the grid , but it is possible that certain assets will be deployed to exclusively serve fossil fuel intensive customers. We encourage CPP Investment s to carefully screen for these impacts. CPP Investments invests globally and could establish more stringent criteria and thresholds . F or investments that improve energy efficiency, CPP Investments has not defined what is considered efficient and investments may not be ambitious. CPP Investments’ description of eligible energy efficiency projects a re vague. As improvements in,‘Second Opinion’ on CPP Invest ments ’ Green Bond Framework 14 energy efficiency can lead to rebound effects and can be tied to fossil fuel intensive activities , clear formulation of eligible projects and methods to mitigate potential rebound effects is crucial. CPP Investments should avoi d funding of projects where the risk of rebound effects is particularly high. CPP Investments’ policy of active ownership in investee companies allows direct engagement to work with companies toward the low carbon transition . The 2019 AODP report referenc ed in the Background section classifies CPP Investments as a “ Learner ” in their engagement with polluting companies. CPP Investments has an opportunity to ramp up its efforts and robustly engag e with more, i f not all , aspects of investee activities.
