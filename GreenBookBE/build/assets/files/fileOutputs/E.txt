1 Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework Evaluation Summary Alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that E.ON ’s Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018. This assessment is based on the following: The eligible categor ies for the use of proceeds – Electricity Networks , Renewable Energy , Energy Efficiency , Clean Transportation – are aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond Pri ncipl es 2018 . Sustainalytics considers that financing of assets in the eligible categories will lead to positive environmental impacts by supporting the uptake of clean energy in Europe and advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals , specifically SDG s 7, 9 and 11 . E.ON ’s Green Bond Comm ittee , composed of representatives from Sustainability, Energy Networks, Customer Solutions and Group Finance and additional subject matter experts as needed , will evaluate and select projects to be included in the Eligible Green Portfolio. Sustainalytics considers the project selection process in line with market practice . E.ON will manage proceed s using a portfolio approach , in which it will strive to maintain a level of allocation that matches or exceeds the balance of net proceeds of outstanding bonds. Pending full allocation, proceeds will be held in its treasury liquidity portfolio in cash, cash equivalents, money market funds, or equivalent. This is in line with market practice. E.ON intends to report on allocation and impact on an annual basis until full allocation . The allocation reporting will include the total amount of assets and capital expenditures in the Green Project Portfolio, the amount of proceeds used for new and/or existing projects and the balance of the unallocated proceeds. In addition, E.ON is committed to impact reporting using quantitative metrics , to be made available in the company’s annual sustainability report . Sustainalytics views E.ON ’s allocation and impact reporting as aligned with market practice.

No categories were determined to be not aligned . Sustainalytics is also of the opinion that the activities and pr ojects to be financed under the Framework will be carried out in alignment with the EU Taxonomy’s Minimum Safeguards.,Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework 2 Introduction E.ON SE (“E.ON”, the “Issuer” or the “Company”) is an energy company and utility based in Essen, Germany, focused on providi ng energy networks and customers energy solutions. Following t he 2019 acquisition of RWEs 76.8 % stake in innogy SE (“innogy”) as part of an extensive asset swap E.ON received innogys grid - and customer solutions businesses while substantially all of E.ON’s and innogy’s renewables businesses transferred to RWE. Today E.ON operates approximately 1.28 million km of electrical grids and natural gas distribution grids serving 34 million cu stomers . E.ON has developed the Green Bond Framework (the “ F ramework ”) under which it intends to issue green bonds and use the proceeds to finance and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and/ or future assets that support the energy transition and climate change mitigation . The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in four areas: 1. Electricity Networks 2. Renewable Energy 3. Energy Efficiency 4. Clean Transportation E.ON engaged Sustainalytics to review E.ON ’s Green Bond Framework , dated February 2021 , and provide a S econd - P arty O pinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) , 1 and the relevant criteria in the EU Taxonomy. 2 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 3 E.ON’s 202 1 Framework updates and replaces both its 2019 Green Bond Framework, for which Sustainalytics provided a previous Second - Party Opinion, 4 as well as the innogy 2017 Green Bond Framework , where applicable . E.ON has confirmed to Sustainalytics that all outsta nding bonds issued by E.ON and previously issued by i nnogy Finance B.V. 5 , as well as all future bonds will be governed by the current Framework. Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ’ Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent 6 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalyti cs assessed the following: • The Framework’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA ; • The Framework’s alignment with the EU Taxonomy; • The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and • The alignment of the issuer ’ s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.6 , which is informed by market practi ce and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of E.ON ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. E.ON representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the so le responsibility of E.ON to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ . 2 Sustainalytics has assessed E.ON’s Framework against the taxonomy criteria of the Draft Delegated Act published November 20, 2020, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/business - economy - euro/banking - and - finance/sustainable - finance/eu - taxonomy - sustainable - activities_en . 3 The E.ON Green Bond Framework is available on E.ON’s website at: https://www.eon.com/en/investor - relations/bonds/green - bonds.html . 4 Sustainalytics’ 2019 Second - Party Opinion is available at: https://www.sustainalytics.com/sustainable - finance/wp - content/uploads/2019/07/E.ON - Green - Bond - Second - Party - Opinion.pdf . 5 The green bond initially issued by innogy, following a bond transfer, now is issued by E .ON’s 100% subsidiary E.ON International Finance B.V. 6 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustai nalytics and ensuring analyst independence is paramount to producing object ive, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust conflict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consistency of process, structural separation of com mercial and research (and engageme nt) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to speci fic commercial outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparency.,Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework 3 (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a time ly manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. Any update of the present Second - Party Opin ion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and E.ON . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants a ny alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the intended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee the rea lised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or argument , either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that E.ON has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second - Party Opinion .,Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework 4 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on E.ON ’s Green Bond Framework Sustainalytics has assessed E.ON ’s Green Bond Framework for its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018 and the EU Taxonomy. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 2018 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that E.ON ’s Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the GBP. For detailed information , please refer to Appendix 4 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of E. ON ’s Green Bond Framework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible categor ies – Electricity Networks , Renewable Energy , Energy Efficiency , Clean Transportation – are aligned with those recognized by the GBP. - E.ON’s Framework defines as eligible the asset value of all electricity distribution infrastructure and equipment that is part of a grid which either meets (i) over 67% of newly connected generation assets comply with the 100gCO 2 /kWh threshold (over a roll ing five - year period) or (ii) an average emissions factor of less than 100gCO 2 /kWh , with the exception of any grid connections for energy generation with a carbon intensity greater than 100gCO 2 /kWh , which E.ON will ensure by excluding the connection of generation other than wind and solar . ▪ Sustainalytics recognizes that E.ON’s Framework is aligned with the European Taxonomy, which considers these quantitative thresholds to be one of several approaches by which a grid can qualify as an eligi ble asset . The EU Taxonomy considers the entirety of the interconnected European System, consisting of the transmission grids of EU member states, along with those of Norway, Switzerland, and the UK, to be eligible. ▪ The six countries in which E.ON operate s electrical grids 7 have grid emissions intensities ranging from 13 to 443 gCO 2 /kWh. 8 E.ON has disclosed that it expects its grids in Sweden and Germany to qualify for financing at this time. ▪ Sustainalytics considers the expansion and maintenance of resilient electricity grids broadly to be supportive of positive environmental outcomes by enabling increases in the use of renewable energy and further electrification of energy systems . Sustainalytics also notes that it has been common practice in the green bond market to finance transmission and distribution assets which are employed predominantly to transmit or enable the use of renewable energy , and that E.ON’s efforts to be stricter than required by the EU Taxon o my , by assessing each grid individually, are indicative of its intent to finance environmentally beneficial projects. ▪ E.ON’s Framework specifies that it will include associated equipment, such as smart meters, to be an eligible part of its electrical networks. Sustainalytics considers infrastructure necessary for the operation of networks, including end - user equipment such as meters, to be a n integral part of such networks, while also highlighting the e nergy efficiency benefits of smart meters themselves. ▪ Sustainalytics views positively E.ON ’s approach for meeting the 100gCO 2 /kWh threshold for connecting generation assets , and notes that by limit ing eligible connections to only those for wind and solar facilities that E.ON not only ensures compliance with the threshold but also applies even more stringent eligibility . - For the “Renewable Energy” category, E.ON intends to finance investments in or exp enditures relate d to the acquisition, conception, construction , development installation of renewable energy pro duction and storage including wind, solar p hoto v oltaic , bioenergy, and hydrogen production storage and distributions infrastructure . Sustainalytics considers these projects well - suited for inclusion in a green bond, noting in particular the following: 7 In order of network length: Germ any, Sweden, Hungary, Romani, Czech Republic, and Slovakia. 8 Based on 2018 European Environment Agency data, see: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data - and - maps/daviz/sds/co2 - emission - intensity - from - electricity - generation - 3/@@view .,Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework 5 ▪ For bioenergy projects , E.ON intends to finance facilities that utilize agricultural biomass compliant with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 2 to 5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001and forest biomass compliant with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7 of that Directive . The GHG savings from the use of biomass in cogeneration installati ons are at least 80% in relation to the GHG emission saving methodology and fossil fuel comparator set out in Annex VI to Directive (EU) 2018/2001. 9 Sustainalytics considers these emissions reductions to be in line with market expectations, and notes that the feedst ocks cited are aligned with the work of the EU TEG 10 and , when sourced responsibly , lead to net - positive outcomes when used in biofuels. ▪ For hydrogen production and storage , the Framework defines as eligible hydrogen production where direct CO 2 emissions from manufacturing are at or below 2.256 tCO 2 e/t H ydrogen; electricity use for hydrogen produced by electrolysis is at or lower than 58 MWh/t Hydrogen; and with an average carbon intensity of the electricity used for hydrogen manufacturing that is at or below 100 gCO 2 /kWh . Based on the work of the EU TEG, Sustainalytics views the production of hydrogen subject to these criteria to be environmentally beneficial. ▪ Sustainalytic s is of the opinion that the storage of energy, either electrically or as hydrogen gas, supports positive environmental outcomes and is aligned with market expectations. - For the “Energy Efficiency” category, E.ON intends to fi nance investments in energy e fficiency related to on - site business and city energy solutions. These products include on - site energy generation and storage as well as energy efficiency upgrades for municipal and large commercial clients. ▪ Sustainalytics notes that these projects have the potential to deliver significant energy savings and contribute to overall environmental and climate goals. 11 ▪ Sustainalytics views the use of waste heat to be aligned with market expectations . ▪ For geothermal energy, the Framework defines as eligible the Cogeneration Threshold , the combined heat/cool and power threshold , of lower than 100 gCO2/kWh per 1 kWh of energy input to the combined generation. ▪ Refer to paragraph above for Sustainalytics commentary regarding bioenergy. - For the “Clean Transportation” category, E.ON intends to finance investments or expenditure for EV charging stations and supporting infrastructure. Sustainalytics views promoting fully electrified transportation systems as a ligned with market expectations. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - E.ON has established the E.ON Green Bond Committee (the “Committee”) , consisting of representatives from Sustainability, Energy Networks, Customer Solutions and Group Finance, as well as other relevant subject matter experts. The Committee will be chaired by the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and will meet at least once a year to assess project eligibility in accordance with the Framework. - Eligible project will be included in the “Eligib le Green Portfolio ” . Assets included in the Eligible Green Portfolio will be evaluated and selected based on compliance with the Framework’s eligibility criteria, alignment with E.ON’s strategic sustainability objectives, the EU environmental objectives , t he relevant metrics, thresholds and Do No Significant Harm (“DNSH”) criteria of the EU Taxonomy and in compliance with applicable national, European and international environmental and social standards and regulations. - Based on the establishment of a Green Bond Committee, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. 9 Directive (EU) 201 8/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council at: https://eur - lex.europa.eu/legal - content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018L2001 10 The Final TEG Report, including relevant technical annexes, is accessible at: https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publicati on/sustainable - finance - teg - final - report - eu - taxonomy_en 11 Examples of projects undertaken by E.ON include providing energy efficiency upgrades to a large commercial client that upgraded HVAC and lighting systems as well as installing electrical sub - meters resulting in a 34% energy savings and a residential district which enables 100% of local heating needs to be met by ground - source heat pumps and solar with peak needs being met by electric and/or bio - oil boilers. Sustainalytics considers these projects to be representative of the potential environmental benefits that investments in this use of proceed s category may provide.,Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework 6 • Management of Proceeds: - E.ON will manage the proceeds of the green bond(s) on a portfolio basis and strive to maintain a level of allocation to the portfolio that matches or exceeds the balance of net proceeds of outstanding bonds within a timeframe of 24 months after issuance . Pendi ng full allocation, proceeds will be held in its treasury liquidity portfolio in cash, cash equivalents, money market funds, or equivalent. ▪ Outstanding bonds include both instruments issued under the 2021 Framework, as well as previous labelled green bond s issued by E.ON or innogy. As E.ON’s management of proceeds approach is on a portfolio basis, the Company will ensure that its green portfolio matches or exceeds the value of all outstanding bonds. - The Committee will monitor the Eligible Green Portfolio and will remove any project that no longer complies with the Eligibility Criteria or that have been disposed of, and it will replace them as soon as reasonably practicable. Sustainalytics views positively this ongoing update of the portfolio, as it prevents double counting of green bond assets by ensuring that newly issued bonds fund new projects. - Based on the disclosure the management approach and of temporary investments, Sustainalytics considers this to be in line with market practice. • Reportin g: - E.ON will provide allocation and, where feasible, impact reporting on an annual basis in the Company’s annual sustainability report made available on their corporate website, as well as ongoing updates related to major developments in a timely manner. - Allocation reporting will include the total amounts invested to each category and subcategory level; mapping of the EU Environmental Objectives pursued by the assets ; the amount and/or percent age of new and existing projects; the (share of financing and refinancing) ; the geographical distribution of assets ; breakdown of the Eligible Green Portfolio by nature of what is being financed (assets, Capex); the balance of unallocated proceeds (if any); a nd a statement of alignment with the EU Green Bond Standard . - Impact reporting may include quantitative indicators as defined in the Framework, such as capacity of renewable energy connected, CO 2 emissions avoided, number of smart grid components installed, and number of electric vehicle charging stations. - Based on the commitment to allocation reporting and the intention to provide impact reporting, including quantitative indicators, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. Alignment with the EU Taxonomy Sustainalytics has assessed each of the Framework’s eligible green use of proceeds criteria against the relevant criteria in the EU Taxonomy and determined their alignment with each of th e Taxonomy’s three sets of requirements. The results of this assessment are as follows: 1. Technical Screening Criteria (“TSC”) − All twelve eligible green criteria in the Framework ’s four categories that were assessed are aligned with the applicable TSC of the EU Taxonomy. 2. Do No Significant Harm (“DNSH”) Criteria − Among the Framework’s 1 2 eligible green c riteria , all 1 2 are aligned with the applicable DNSH criteria . − The 1 2 criteria assessed have a total of 4 4 individual DNSH criteria (across all environmental objectives) applicable to them, and all 44 are aligned with the DNSH criteria. 3. Minimum Safeguards − Based on a consideration of the policies and management systems applicable to Framework criteria, as well as the regulatory context in which financing will occur, Sustainalytics is of the view the EU Taxonomy’s Minimum Safeguards requirements will be met. − For Sustainalytics’ assessment of alignment with the Minimum Safeguard s see Section 2 below.,Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework 7 Table 1 provides an overview of the alignment of the E.ON ’s Framework with the Technical Screening Criteria (TSC) and the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria for the corresponding NACE activities in the EU Taxonomy.

In cases where an activity of the Framework has the intent of advancing a different Objective, Sustainalytics has assessed al ign ment against the DNSH criteria for all six Objectives. Section 2: Sustainability Performance of E.ON Contribution of F ramework to E.ON ’s sustainability strategy E.ON has a strong commitment to sustainability that is rooted in its corporate strategy and organizational culture. In 2018 the Board of Management signed a self - commitment to the SDGs, in which it is stated that at E.ON, “We believe that good corporate govern ance accompanies and substantially contributes to our long -,Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework 8 term business success”. 12 The statement goes on to outline the company’s specific goals, which are related to SDGs 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities and 13: Cli mate Action. 12 To put this commitment in place, the Company has adopted several plans and targets such as: 13 • Reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 75% by 2030 and by 100% by 2040 (vs. 2019) ; • Reduce its Scope 3 emissions by 50% by 2030 and by 100% by 2050 (vs. 2019) ; • Carbon - neutral buildings by 2030 ; • E lectrif y its fleet by 2030 . E.ON is committed to advancing the energy tra nsition and increasing the share of renewable energy in the electricity grid. In order to do so, one of E.ON’s areas of focus is the construction of powerlines and substations, as well facilitating the proliferation of smart grids and smart metering, which can be used to mitigate variable renewable energy output and increase overall grid efficiency. Initiatives to achieve this include the “Smart Grid Hub” developed by Avacon, one of E.ON ’s network operators in Germany, which enables the control of grid - connected systems such as PV installations or battery storage remotely . 14 As of 201 9 , the company had installed approximately 4 .4 million smart meters a cross Europe, 15 and has the target to roll out a total of roughly 14.5 million in all its markets by year - end 2026. 16 One of E.ON’s material topics has become “ sustainable c ustomer s olutions ” which is geared towards increasing building energy efficiency for business and residential properties and consists of: “Lower - carbon households,” “More energy - efficient companies,” and “Greener, smarter cities .” 17 The company is also committed to increasing the availability of plug - in charging stations for electric vehicles, and as part of its Green Bond projects financ ed the Company installed 3,218 charging points across Europe as of year - end 2019 . 18 E.ON has a robust commitment to transparency and reporting, which is demonstrated in their public sustainability reports. 19 Sustainalytics views the Use of Proceeds for this EU Green Bond Framework to be well aligned with E.ON’s sustainability strategy and the broader UN SDGs. For example, the introduction of additional smart grid capacity and intercon nections for renewable will support carbon reduction and renewable energy goals, while the sustainable customer solutions and electric vehicle investments will support their internal goals for improving customers’ environmental performance. Well - positione d to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects Sustainalytics recognizes that the net proceeds from the bonds and/or loans issued under the Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are recognized by the GB P to have an overall positive impact and will contribute to global climate goals. Nevertheless, as with any infrastructure projects, it is important to ensure that there are strong mitigation measures in place to address any environmental and social risks that may arise. For example, the construction of the various projects funded by the bonds can pose challenges to worker health and safety, have an adverse impact on land use and biodiversity, and affect community relations. E.ON has policies, procedures and c ertifications in place to mitigate associated risks. 14 Regarding the management of health, safety, and the environment (“HSE”), the Company has a group - wide HSE Risk Management System aligned with standards ISO 45001 ( Occupational Health and Safety), ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems ) or EU Eco - Management and Audit Scheme ( EMAS ) and/or ISO 50001 (Energy Management Systems) . The company publicly reports all environment - related incidents and has had no “major impact” incident occur over the past three years and two “serious” incident s . 20 , 21 In order to build up a strong health and safety culture, the company initiated specialized training for senio r managers to better assess potential safety hazards. 14 In 2019 , the company reported a 96% health rate for employees, which reflects the number of days worked in relation to the agreed working t ime. 14 Additionally, the company publicly reports on Total Recordable Injury Frequency and Lost Time Injury Frequency. The low overall rate of injuries, 12 E.ON , “ SDG Board Commitment ”, (2018) at: https://www.eon.com/content/dam/eon/eon - com/Documents/en/lei tlinien - nachhaltigkeit/Boardcommitment_June_2018.pdf . 13 E.ON, “Sustainability Strategy”, (2020), at: https://www.eon.com/en/about - us/sustainability/strategy.html . 14 E.ON, “Energy Transition in our Networks”, at: https://www.eon.com/en/about - us/sustainability/en ergy - transition - networks.html . 15 E.ON, “Sustainability Report 2019”, at: https://www.eon.com/en/about - us/sustainability/sustainability - report.html . 16 E.ON, “Sustain ability Report 2018”, at: https://www.eon.com/en/about - us/sustainability/sustainability - report.html . 17 E.ON, “Sustainability Report 2019”, at: https://www.eon.com/en/about - us/sustainability/sustainability - report.html . 18 E.ON, “Sustainability Report 2019”, at: https://www.eon.com/en/about - us/sustainability/sustainability - report.html . 19 E:ON, “Sustainability Report”, at: https://www.eon.com/en/about - us/su stainability/sustainability - report.html . 20 E.ON’s incident management system classifies environmental events on a 0 - to - 4 sca le, with 0 being no damage and 4 being major . A major impact event is considered to have, for example, “irreparable damage to protected habitats”. A “serious” incident is classified as a 3 on this scale and could be “ environmental damage which is expected to last longer than 4 weeks to resolve ”. 21 E.ON , “ Sus tainability in Figures” ( 2019), at: https://www.eon.com/en/about - us/sustainability/facts - and - figures.html .,Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework 9 combines with the fact that the frequency of these metrics has remained stable over the past three years 22 demonstrates E.ON’s ongoing commitment to a safe work environment. It should be noted that after an uptick in the number of fatal accidents in 2018 compared to five in 2017 and four in 2016 , t he C ompany started an engagement process with its senior managers in 2017 to identify areas for improving worker health and safety. 23 Furthermore, E.ON started a new safety culture initiative , “How We Care , ” in 2018 to raise awareness for safe working conditions and behavio u rs in order to avoid major incidents. 24 E.ON recognizes the importance of stakeholder engagement and community involvement as part of its risk management strategy. E.ON’s Sustainability Council (the “Council”) , chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer ( “ CS O”) , engages with outside stakeholders a nd seeks external partnerships. 25 Stakeholders are invited to participate throughout the development process and E.ON strives to account for short - and long - term impacts on stakeholder groups. The Sustainability Council advises the Management Board on the involvement of external stakehold ers and analyses the trends and expectations of these groups. The company customizes stakeholder engagement approaches to the specific needs of their regional units and provides a publicly - accessible overview of the internal guidelines, policies and proced ures in their annual sustainability report. Based on the policies, procedures and certification described above, Sustainalytics views E.ON as having robust risk mitigation procedures in place and considers E.ON to be well - placed to mitigate relevant envir onmental and social risks associated with the projects funded by the green bonds. The C ompany has demonstrated a clear commitment to transparency in their annual sustainability report s , providing detailed information on each of these issues. Alignment wit h the EU Taxonomy’s Minimum Safeguards Alignment with the EU Taxonomy’s Minimum Safeguards requires that the Issuer have in place a set of policies or regulations, as well as supporting management systems and processes, that provide assurance that the acti vities financed by a bond are carried out in a manner that meets OECD and other international guidelines for responsible business conduct. 26 The f ollow ing are the policies, regulations and commitments made b y E.ON to uphold social safeguards pertaining to human and labour rights, and to combating bribery, bribe solicitation and extortion . E.ON’s Human Rights Policy Statement acknowledges the International Bill of Human Rights and the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the Interna tional Labour Organisation and its fundamental conventions. 27 In its Code of Conduct 28 E.ON pledges to support the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and highlights the Company’s commitment towards preserving human rights as well as the principle of equal treatment and supporting diversity. E.ON’s Slavery & Human Trafficking Statement describes the steps taken by the Company to prevent and combat human rights violations along its supply chain and highlights Company’s commitment towards the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015.

Based on the assessment above, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that E.ON ’s policies, guidelines and commitments are suffici ent to demonstrate that the activities and projects to be financed under the Framework will be carried out in alignment with the EU Taxonomy’s Minimum Safeguards. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All four use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP. Sustainalytics has focused below on where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context. I mportance of grid investm ents for the integration of renewable s The development of renewable energy production requires grid access. In Europe, the electricity sector was developed nationally and centralized with large power plants being situated near large - scale industrial areas and metropolitan hubs. 35 Renewable electricity plants generally have a smal ler scale of generation and a more diverse geographical spread. 35 As stated in EC Directive 2009/28/EC, “There is a need to support the integration of energy from renewable sources into the transmission and distribution grid and the use of energy storage syst ems for integrated intermittent production of energy from renewable sources.” 36 Grid connection has been identified as a barrier to investment in utility - scale renewable energy projects, and represents one of the significant costs in the development of re newable energy projects, presenting a potential barrier to investment. 37 By financing the connection of renewable energy production units to the grid, including powerlines, substations and other infrastructure, and developing new renewable energy capacity, E.ON’s green bonds will help reduce technical bottlenecks for the European renewable energy market. In addition to physical interconnection, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are unable to provide a consistent source of energy due to natural variability in weather conditions, which can be characterized as an intermittent generation profile. 38 , 39 One of the important technologies for addressing this challenge is smart grid. 40 Smart grids actively monitor energy flows and adjust to changes in s upply and demand, through increased communication, more efficient transmission routing, improved demand management, and other technologies. 40 Smart gri ds can assist in the integration of renewable energy, and the EU has set a target of replacing 80% of electricity meters with smart meters by 2020. 40 E .ON has access to approximately 50 million customers across Europe, the company has demonstrated its ability to improve energy networks and has a vision for decentralizing the energy sector. By investing in grid modernization, E.ON’s green bonds will suppo rt the greater adoption of renewable energy in the markets it serves. Impact of energy storage Energy storage has been a historical impediment to increasing the capacity and efficiency of renewable energy systems. 41 In response to an intermittent generation profile, energy storage can mitigate volatility in 32 E.ON, Code of Conduct - Compliance & Integrity Commitment, 20 19, at: https://www.eon.com/content/dam/eon/eon - com/Documents/en/compliance - and - integrity/code - of - conduct/201 80718_EON_Code_of_Conduct.pdf 33 E.ON, Code of Conduct - Compliance & Integrity Commitment, 2019, at: https:/ /www.eon.com/content/dam/eon/eon - com/Documents/en/compliance - and - integrity/code - of - conduct/20180718_EON_Code_of_Conduct.pdf 34 E.ON, Code Of Responsible Conduct For Business, 2010, at: https://www.eon.com/content/dam/eon/eon - com/Documents/en/compliance - and - integrity/documents - guidelines/Code_of_Responsible_Conduct_for_Business.pdf 35 Ecorys (2008 ), “Assessment of non - cost barriers to renewable energy growth in EU Member States”, accessed (27.2.19) at: https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/docum ents/2010_non_cost_barriers.pdf 36 Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, at: https://eur - lex.europa.eu/legal - content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32009L0028&from=EN 37 Hu, J. et al.

Importanc e of clean transportation in mitigating CO 2 emissions It is estimated that passenger vehicles are responsible for approximately 12% of total EU CO 2 emissions. 45 European electric vehicles sales increase every year, electric car “sales soared by more than 4 0% in the first half of [2018]” compared to 2017. 46 However, in order to handle the increase of plug - in cars, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association estimates that the current number of 100,000 charging stations across Europe will need to increa se at least 20 times to 2 million by 2025. 47 Currently, about 76% of charging stations in Europe are located in just four countries: the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK. 47 A 2018 report published by the European Environment Agency noted that investments into vehicle recharging infrastructure are severely lacking and there are not enough EU member states providing economic incentives. 48 Given this landscape, by using proceeds of green bond(s) to finance the development of new charging stations, E.ON can have a clear and tangible impact on the access and availability of charging stations for plug - in vehicles. Furthe rmore, if E.ON strategically locates new charging stations in areas of need, they will likely have an even greater impact and can help reduce the disproportionate distribution that currently exists.

ON has developed a Green Bond Framework under which it will issue green bonds and the use of proceeds to (re) finance assets and capital expenditures that support the energy transition and climate change mitigation . Sustainalytics considers that the projects funded by the green bond proceeds will provide positive environmental impact s . The Green Bond Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and includes commitments for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that E.ON ’s Green Bond Framework is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use of proc eeds categories will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 7, 9 and 11. Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that E.ON has adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds. Sustainalytics has assessed E.ON ’s Green Bond Framework for alignment with the EU Taxonomy, and is of the opinion that, of the Framework’s 12 eligibility criteria (across four use of proceeds categories), which map to 1 2 EU activities, 12 align with the applicable Technical Screening Criteria (“TSC”) in the EU Taxonomy and that all 1 2 align with the Do No Significant Harm Criteria. No categories were determined to be not aligne d . Sustainalytics is also of the opinion that the activities and projects to be financed under the Framework will be carried out in alignment with the EU Taxonomy’s Minimum Safeguards. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that E.ON SE is well - positioned to issue green bonds and that the Green Bond Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018.,13 Appendi ces Appendix 1: Approach to Assessing Alignment with the EU Taxonomy Approach to Alignment Assessment Sustainalytics has assessed each of the eligible green use of proceeds criteria in the Framework against the criteria for the relevant NACE 49 activity in the EU Taxonomy. This appendix describes Sustainalytics’ process and presents the outcome of its assessment of alignment with the Taxonomy’s applicable Technical Screening Criteria (TSC) and Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria. Sustainalytics’ assessment involves two steps: 1. Mapping Framework Criteria to Activities in the EU Taxonomy The initial step in Sustainalytics’ assessment process involves mapping each criterion in the Framework to a relevant and app licable NACE activity in the EU Taxonomy. Note that each Framework criterion may be relevant and applicable to more than one NACE a ctivity and vice versa. Sustainalytics recognizes that some Framework criteria relate to projects that do not map well to a NACE activity. In such cases Sustainalytics has mapped to the NACE activity that is most relevant with respect to the primary envir onmental objective and impacts. In some cases, the Framework criteria cannot be mapped to an activity in the EU Taxonomy, as some activities are not yet cove red by the Taxonomy, and some categories which are traditionally included in green bonds may not be associated with a specific econ omic activity. While recognizing that financing projects in these areas may still have environmental benefits, Sustainalytics has not assessed these criteria for alignment. The outcome of Sustainalytics’ mapping process for the E.ON’s Framework is shown i n Table 2 below. 2. Determining Alignment with EU Taxonomy Criteria The second ste p in Sustainalytics’ process is to determine the alignment of each criterion with relevant criteria in the EU Taxonomy. Align ment with the TSC and DNSH criteria is usually ba sed on the specific criteria contained in the issuer’s Framework, and may in many cases (especially DNSH criteria) also be ba sed on management systems and processes and/or regulatory compliance. To assess alignment with the EU Taxonomy’s Minimum Safeguards Sustainalytics has conducted an assessment of policies, management systems and processes applicable to the use of proceeds, as well as examining the regulatory context in the geographical location in which the issuer will finance activities and projects. (This assessment is included in Section 2, above.) In cases where the Framework criteria describe projects which are intended to advance EU environmental objectives other than Climate Mitigation or Climate Adaptation, the Taxonomy does not include relevant TSC. In these cases, Sustainalytics has assessed the activity for alignment with the DNSH criteria across all objectives. Sustainalytics’ detailed assessment of alignment is provided in Appendix 2. 49 The EU Taxonomy is based on economic activities defined in NACE (Nomenclature des Activités Économiques dans la Commu nauté Européenne). The Taxonomy currently lists 70 economic activities which have been chosen due to their ability to substantially contribute to climate change mitigation or a daptation.,Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework 14 Table 2: Framework mapping table 50 Sustainalytics has assessed the transportation of hydrogen using the same methodology as the storage of hydrogen.

The issuer has developed a plan to implement adaptation solutions to reduce material physical climate risks to the selected activities under this framework. • For new activities the Issuer ensures that a daptation solutions do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of assets and of other economic activities and are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national ada ptation efforts. • For activities that involve upgrading or altering existing assets or processes, the Issuer must implement adaptation solutions identified within five years from the start of the activity. In addition, selected adaptation solutions must not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of assets and of other economic activities and are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation efforts. E.ON uses a multistep process to identify, evaluate, simulate, and classify risks and opportunities. Risks and opportunities are generally reported on the basis of objective evaluations. When not possible, the Company uses internal estimates elaborated by subject m atter experts. E.ON then evaluates the likelihood of occurrence of all quantifiable risks and opportunities. E.ON continually monitors and assesses its sustainability, climate, and other non - financial risks and opportunities, and their potential impact in the short, medium, and long term. In 2018 the Company began to integrate the assessment and management of these risks more systematically into its overall risk management. This process is ongoing and, from 2020 onward, it incorporated the TCFD’s recommenda tions. The status of this process is presented to the E.ON Group Risk Committee on a regular basis. E.ON’s analysis encompassed physical risks (such as extreme weather and rising temperatures) as well as transitional risks (such as changes in consumer pref erences, the regulatory environment, and carbon prices). The joint interaction between the Risk Management & Sustainability at the Group and local level further promotes climate risk assessment. In order to take account of the increasing awareness on non - financial risks, the link between sustainability and risk management was intensified in 2019 and 2020, the Company intends to further expand it. This includes a concrete allocation of tasks. Aligned 57 The EU Delegated Act identifies several climate related risk and classifies them into chronic or acute risks, Chronic risks i nclude - c hanging temperature (air, freshwater, marine water) , c hanging wind patterns , c hanging precipitation patterns and types , coastal erosion, heat stress, o cean acidification , sea - level rise, and s olifluction . Acute risks pertain to – heat/ cold wave, wildfire, cyclone, hurricane, tornado, storm, drought, landslide, flood, and glacial la ke outburst.

In addition to using external climate scenarios, E.ON develops its own scenario in collaboration with external service providers. The goal of the scenario is to map a transition of the EU energy system that is consistent with the EU’s dec arbonization goals in keeping global warming to below 2°C. In this context, E.ON discusses the most important input parameters for the scenario development, including socio - economic factors, assumptions on fossil fuel prices, cost development of green key technologies and key policy instruments with the provider. The process is steered by the Corporate Strategy supported by various other teams to ensure the best reflection of the group’s view on future energy developments. Members from the energy sourcing t eam and from regional offices help to assess future cost reduction for power generation and members from the storage solution business discuss the likelihood and level of cost reduction for batteries. Projections on, amongst others, energy demand growth, t he future deployment of renewables and distributed energy sources, the future need for energy infrastructure and the need for synthetic energy carriers are compared and consequences for E.ON’s strategic position derived. Since E.ON’s business is concentrat ed around the use of power, heat and natural gas, as well as energy networks, E.ON studies climate scenarios to better understand future energy demand and the build - out of grid infrastructure. E.ON’s integrated risk management system and organisation structures and processes ensures that climate risks are considered throughout the company and beyond the activities financed under the Green Bond Framework. E.ON’s Management Board has overall responsibi lity for the Company’s sustainability strategy, including its climate strategy, and the Chief Sustainability Officer (“CSO”) has quarterly reports about important initiatives and developments as well as key performance indicators. The CSO manages and monit ors all of the,Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework 34 Company’s sustainability activities and chairs the Sustainability Council. The Supervisory Board is regularly informed about E.ON’s sustainability performance by its Audit and Risk Committee and by the Management Board. Furthermore, E.ON’s G reen Bond Framework defines eligibility criteria. The process of evaluating and selecting projects has several steps and draws on the expertise of several units and departments. The Sustainability department is responsible for ensuring that eligible projec ts have no ESG concerns and comply with all relevant company policies and guidelines as well as national laws , and therefore comply with the intent of that adaptation solutions do not ”adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to p hysical climate risks of other people, of nature, of assets and of other economic activities and are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation efforts” . E.ON has provided supporting documentation to indicate the implementation of n ature - based solution where feasible. An example of this is its programme to ecologically manage the area below power lines, by prioritizing biodiversity and an intact and healthy ecosystem for these areas.

Second - Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second - Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond fram ework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second - Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Pro ceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or c laims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of p roceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification.,Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework 41 iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the cert ification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating a gencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is dis tinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion E.ON Green Bond Framework 42 Disclaimer Copyright ©202 1 Sustainalytics.
