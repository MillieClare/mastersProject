C O M / E S G 4 o f 2 3 ISS ESG ASSESSMENT SUMMARY 1 ISS ESG ’s evaluation is based on Acea ’s Green Financing Framework , on the analysed Eligible Project categories as received in January 202 1 and on the ISS ESG Corporate Rating applicable at the SPO delivery date (updated on the 24.02.2020). 2 Rank relative to industry group. 1 indicates a high relative ESG performance, while 10 indicates a low relative ESG performan ce. SPO SECTION SUMMARY EVALUATION1 Part 1: Issuer sustainability performance The issuer is rated 12th out of 60 companies within the Utilities/ Multi Utilities sector as of 16.01.2021. This equates to a high relative performance, with a Decile Rank2 of 2. Status: Not Prime Decile Rank: 2 Part 2: Alignment with GBPs and GLPs The issuer has defined a formal concept for its green financing instrument regarding use of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the GBPs and GLPs. Positive Part 3: Sustainability quality of the eligible projects selection criteria The overall sustainability quality of the eligible projects selection criteria in terms of sustainability benefits, risk avoidance and minimisation is good based upon the ISS ESG assessment. The eligible project categories include “ circular economy projects ” such as wastewater management, anaerobic digestion of bio- waste and/or sewage sludge, waste management, water supply, smart meters, electric vehicles, charging station for electric vehicles, energy efficiency improvement in transmission and distribution networks, and solar PV. These categories have a significant contribution to SDG 6 ‘ Clean Water and Sanitation’, 7 ‘Affordable and Clean Energy’ , 12 ‘Responsible Production and Consumption’ and 13 ‘Climate Action ’ . They also have a limited contribution to SDG 3 ‘Good Health and Wellbeing’ and 9 ‘Industry Innovation and Infrastructure’.

C O M / E S G 5 o f 2 3 ISS ESG SPO ASSESSMENT PART I: ASSESSMENT OF ACEA ’ S ESG PERFORMANCE Methodological note: To introduce the assessment of the sustainability quality of this Green Bond, ISS ESG wants to emphasis the current ESG strategy of the issuer. Please note that this section of the SPO is extracted from the ISS ESG Corporate Rating of Acea . As the ESG Corporate Rating does not reflect certain recent developments at the time of publication of this SPO , the assessment below has been partly amended. The ISS ESG Corporate Rating provides material and forward - looking environmental, social and governance (ESG) data and performance assessments. ESG performance As of 1 6 . 01 .202 1 , this R ating places Acea 12 th out of 60 companies rated by ISS ESG in the Utilities/ Multi Utilities sector. Key Challenges faced by companies in term of sustainability management in this sector are displayed in the chart on the right . The issuer performs better than its industry average on 4 out of 5 key ESG challenges relevant for its industry. Sustainability Opportunities Acea S.p.A. ( Acea ) is a multi - utility company, which is principally engaged in the water, wastewater, energy and waste treatment sector. In 2019 , energy supply accounted for over 50% of revenues while 31.3 % of the company's rev enues were based on water supply. With the purification of water as well as the provision of clean drinking water and sanitary services, the company contributes to the global goal to ensure universal access to water. The company is also engaged in some rel evant activities in this regard in Honduras, Peru and the Dominican Republic. C O M P A N Y A C E A D E C I L E R A N K 2 T R A N S P A R E N C Y L E V E L V E R Y H I G H,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Is s ue r and Gre e n Financ ing Frame w ork I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 6 o f 2 3 In 2019 , Acea ’ s energy generation was mainly based on hydropower ( 47.1 %) and waste - to - energy ( 39.5 %), followed by natural gas ( 9.8 %). Solar power and biogas accounted for 1 .2 % an d 2.2 % respectively, and a very low share (0.1%) was also based on diesel. If the biogenic share of waste incinerated is also taken into account the renewable energy share of total generation is comparatively high with 70 .2% in 2019 . In the 2020 - 2024 Busin ess Plan presented by Acea in October 2020, the Company has committed to materially increase the proportion of renewable energy installed capacity as evidenced by the increase in FTV installed capacity from 36MW in 2019 to 747MW in 2024. Further, with 374 g/kWh , the carbon intensity of electricity generation is still at a common industry level. Sustainability Risks Acea has established clear greenhouse gas emission targets regarding its direct and indirect emissions, but it is unclear whether they are in line with emission reductions required to reach global climate goals , although the Company at the end of 2020 has init iated a project to define a SBT . Further, although the company relies to a large extent on hydropower generation, it does not elaborate on its management approach to reduce related negative environmental impacts . With regard to its water business, the comp any refers to some relevant measures to ensure sustainable water withdrawal and has taken various measures to reduce leakages from the water distribution system, but its current leakage rate is comparatively high ( for example, for Ato 2, Acea’s largest wat er company, the leakage rate was 4 4 % in 2019 ) : the Company is committed to reduce water leakage by 11 p.p. on average by 2024 . The company has taken measures to ensure environmentally friendly wastewater management, e.g. with regard to sludge and treatment standards, and to reduce impacts of the operation of waste - to - energy plants . Although comprehensive health and safety management systems are documented, there may be some deficiencies regarding its implementation , as Acea ’ s accident rate is high . Acea ’ s code of ethics includes general provisions on important issues including corruption and antitrust violation. However, other aspects such as facilitation payments are not covered. Corresponding compliance procedures are in place, e.g. compliance risk asses sments, trainings and confidential hotlines. Governance opinion Acea is majority - owned by the City of Rome (51.1% of total share capital as at February 3, 2020). The company's governance structure exhibits some deficiencies. While the company's board of di rectors is mainly composed of independent members, the company’s chair Michaela Castelli cannot be classified as being independent (as at December 18, 2019). While largely independent board committees in charge of nomination and remuneration , and in charge of ethics and sustainability, have been set up, 3 out of 4 members of the audit committee are independent . The company discloses its remuneration policy for executives, including long - term components, which could encourage sustainable value creation. The company has established an ethics and sustainability committee, which is composed of 4 independent members (as of 2020) . Additionally, members of the executive team are entitled to monetary bonuses for the attainment of sustainability targets. No more deta iled information on the targets is available. Acea 's code of ethics includes general provisions on important issues including corruption and antitrust violation. However, other aspects such as facilitation payments and insider dealings are not covered. Cor responding compliance procedures are in place, e.g. compliance risk assessments, trainings and confidential hotlines.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Is s ue r and Gre e n Financ ing Frame w ork I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

C O M / E S G 1 0 o f 2 3 research and development expenditures. In the case of operatin g expenditures, this includes a look - back period of up to 3 calendar years prior to the issuance of Green Bonds. Through the Green financing instruments in the scope of this framework, Acea will not finance and/or refinance any projects related to fossils fuel activities and any energy production facilities with an energy intensity above 100gCO 2 e/kWh . Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the Use of Proceeds description provided by Acea align s with the GBPs and GLPs . Expected environmental benefits are clearly displayed and the eligible categories are aligned with the broader strategy of the issuer toward sustainability . Moreover, the issuer built these macro investment areas along the lines of the UN 2030 Agenda. Regarding the operating expenditures, IS S ESG suggests to decrease the look - back period from 3 to 2 years, as per market best practices. 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection Acea’s Green Finance W orking G roup is composed by members of Finance, Planning & Control and Sustainability Planning & Reporting departments . It is chaired by the CFO. Acea’s Green Finance Working Group will be in charge of monitoring the selection and allocation process as per the eligibility criteria defined in the Use of Proceeds section above. As such, the Green Finance Working Group will be responsible for the following: • Reviewing and validating the selection of Eligible Green Projects in accordance with the defined Eligible Green Project Categories listed in the Use of Proceeds section, • Monitoring the Eligible Green Project portfolio during the life of the transaction. The working group or Committee can decide to replace an Eligible Green Project if it no longer meets the eligibility criteria, • Monitoring any ESG controversy (such as controversies that may impact local communities or changes in ecosystems) that are directly related to an Eligible Green Project. • If the Sustainability department deems that an eligible project becomes subject to a major ESG controversy, the Green Fina nce Working Group will analyze it and may decide to exclude and replace such Eligible Green Project, • Managing any future update of the Green Financing Framework. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the Pro cess for Project Evaluation and Selection provided by Acea aligns with the GBPs and GLPs . Through the creation of a working group, Acea is ensuring that r elevant internal stakeholders are involved in this process. The issuer sets a structured and transparent project selec tion process, including monitoring for eventual changes or controversies in projects.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Is s ue r and Gre e n Financ ing Frame w ork I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 1 o f 2 3 3. Management of Proceed s An amount equivalent to net proceeds of each Green financing will be allocated to disbursements for Eligible Green Projects and managed by the Green Finance Working Group . For Bond issuances, Acea endeavors on a best effort basis to reach full allocation within two years following the issuance of each Green Bond. The Green Finance Working Group will monitor and track the net proceeds through a dedicated reporting. Pending full allocation, unallocated proceeds may temporarily be invested in accordance wit h Acea’s investment guidelines in cash, deposits and money market instruments or SRI Investment. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the description of the Management of Proceeds provided by Acea aligns with the GBPs and GLPs . Appropriate tracking of the proceeds is in place and intended types of temporary investment instruments for unallocated proceeds are disclosed , reflecting good market practices. 4. Reporting Acea commits to publish annually an allocation report and an impact report, as detailed below. The allocation report and the impact report will be provided until full allocation. Allocation Reporting The reporting will be produced on a portfolio basis. It will provide: • the amount of net proceeds allocated per Eligible Green Project category • the perc entage of refinancing in existing projects, • the amount of unallocated proceeds, if any, at the date of reporting, • location and status of the projects. This information will be publicly available on the Acea’s website. Impact Reporting Acea will provide an impact report to support the allocation report described above. Key environmental impact indicators per Eligible Green Project Category will include estimated expected impact reporting metrics when feasible, such as: Pillar of Acea ’s business plan Possible output indicators Impact indicators Water Management • Volume of water distributed (m3) • Numbers of gauges installed for pressure and flow rate management Estimated annual reduction in volume of water losses (m3/year),S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Is s ue r and Gre e n Financ ing Frame w ork I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

The issuer gives details about level, frequency, scope and duration of reporting for both allocation and impact reporting. Impact indicators are well defined, and intended public disclosure further enhances the quality of the reporting. External review Second Party Opinion A leading Second Party Provider will issue a Second - Party Opinion on the Framework, to confirm the alignment of the Framework to the ICMA’s Green Bond Principles and LMA ’s Green Loan Principle. T he Second Party Opinion document will be made available on Acea’s website. Post issuance external verification An external verification on the allocation reporting will be provided, by Acea’s auditors, on an annual basis and until the complete allocation o f proceeds. The external auditor will verify that the proceeds of the bonds are either allocated to Eligible Projects or invested in approved financial instruments. This will be published on Acea’s website.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Is s ue r and Gre e n Financ ing Frame w ork I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SELECTION CRITERIA OF THE ELIGIBLE PROJECT S ISS ESG KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS The ISS ESG KPI ensures that environmental and social risks attached to the projects financed are taken into consideration and have been minimized. This assessment is based on the issuer’s polices and strategy regarding ESG risks minimization in its assets selection proce ss. A S S E S S M E N T A G A I N S T I S S E S G K P I ESG risk minimisation of selection process The issuer confirms it underwent an appropriate and detailed selection process aiming at reducing material physical risks in all projects. All projects are implemented in Italy, where environmental and social impact must be minimized according to national legislation. Therefore, climate risk assessments such as Environmental Impact Assessments have been carried out when required by legislation. Acea has established a Green Finance Working Group monitoring the Eligible Green Project portfolio during the life of the transaction for any ESG controversy (such as controversies that may impact local communities or changes in ecosystems) that are directly related to an Eligible Green Project. The issuer has implemented an Environmental Management System (ISO 14001). Labour and Health & Safety All projects provide for high labour and health and safety standards for construction and maintenance work (e.g. ILO core conventions). The company has implemented an Internal Control and Risk Management System (ICRMS) aiming at enforcing and monitoring labour and health and safety practices within the company. End-of-life decommissioning and recycling More than 50% of the asset pool have dedicated recycling or end-of-life decommissioning measures as part of planning and construction contracts. Moreover, as per regulation, environmental risk assessments all cover minimum environmental safeguards during the whole lifespan of the project, including end-of-life.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Is s ue r and Gre e n Financ ing Frame w ork I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

C O M / E S G 2 1 o f 2 3 ANNEX 2 : Methodology ISS ESG KPIs The ISS ESG Green KPIs serves as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality of the selection process of the use of proceeds and ensure that ESG risks associated with the use of proceeds have been taken into consideration by the issuer and minimized. The KPI asse ssment is conducted at the macro - level and focuses on three criteria, being core to all green categories (i.e. ESG risk minimization of selection process ; Circular economy; and Labour and Health & Safety). The assessment is based on the issuer’s company p olicies and ESG initiatives. The evaluation was carried out using information and documents provided to ISS ESG on a confidential basis by Acea (e.g. Due Diligence Reports).

The agency analyses companies and countries regarding their environmental and social performance. As part of our Sustainable ( Green & Social) Bo nd Services, we provide support for companies and institutions issuing sustainable bonds, advise them on the selection of categories of projects to be financed and help them to define ambitious criteria. We assess alignment with external principles (e.g. the ICMA Green / Social Bond Principles ), analyse the sustainability quality of the assets and review the sustainability performance of the issuer themselves. Following these three steps, we draw up an independent SPO so that investors are as well informed as possible about the q uality of the bond / loan from a sustainability perspective .
