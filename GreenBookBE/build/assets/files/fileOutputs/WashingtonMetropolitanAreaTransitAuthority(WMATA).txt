This Verifier’s Report reflects Kestrel Verifiers’ view of the Authority’s projects and financing, allocation and oversight, and conformance of the bonds with the Climate Bonds Standard (V3.0), and the Transport sector criteria (Version 2). In our opinion, the Bonds are aligned with the internationally accepted Climate Bonds Standard and the Transport criteria (Version 2). ABOUT THE ISSUER The WMATA operates and maintains the public transportation system in the Washington DC metropolitan area which includes parts of Maryland and Virginia. The public transportation system consists of Metrorail, Metrobus, and MetroAccess. The Metrorail system is fully electrified and is the second busiest rail transit system in the U.S according to the 2020 Public Transportation Fact Book. The rail system consists of 91 stations and 118 miles of rail. WMATA’s Metrobus system is the sixth busiest bus system in the U.S. and maintains 168 bus lines and at least 1200 buses. MetroAccess is a paratransit system that provides door- to-door service to individuals with disabilities that prevent them from accessing standard bus and rail systems. The Authority recognizes the wide-ranging impact of its system and is committed to environmental sustainability in operations and service at both small and large scales. The transportation system is one of the largest energy users in the region and hosts more than one million average weekday trips (prior to COVID-19). At a small scale, each individual rider using the online Trip Planner is given information about how much greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions they will offset by riding public transit instead of driving alone to their destination. At a large scale, WMATA actively pursues renewable energy purchase contracts and incorporates stormwater management to meet Chesapeake Bay watershed’s water quality standards. The Authority also has a history of pursuing innovative partnerships to collaboratively solve challenges in areas ranging from tree plantings to transit-oriented development. Kestrel’s review revealed a selection of noteworthy achievements in reducing environmental impacts: • Construction of a net-zero wastewater treatment plant which treats water from Metrorail tunnels • System-wide chiller and lighting replacement programs reduce energy use and energy costs • Expansion of Metrorail regenerative braking systems,3 • Completion of solar lease agreements to host up to 12.8 MW of community solar on canopies over surface lots and at rail stations Another unique feature of WMATA’s system is the Sustainability Lab which exists for the sole purpose of facilitating innovation in sustainability. The Lab tests new technologies at small scales before broad adoption and has proven to be a highly valuable resource for improvements. Since its inception, it has enabled completion of a comprehensive energy audit, development of the Energy Action Plan, agreements to implement the community solar project, improved efficiency of switch heaters, and remote water treatment and chiller monitoring. The Authority has also demonstrated leadership by laying groundwork to incorporate the comprehensive Envision sustainable infrastructure framework into many aspects of planning and design. Envision is managed by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure (“ISI”) and provides a framework for building and maintaining sustainable, resilient, and equitable infrastructure. ISI was established by the American Public Works Association, the American Society of Civil Engineers, and the American Council of Engineering Companies. Infrastructure projects may receive an Envision Rating based on 64 credits received in five categories: Quality of Life, Leadership, Resource Allocation, Natural World, and Climate and Resilience. To infuse sustainable infrastructure practices across the organization, WMATA has begun training approximately 70 employees to become Envision Sustainability Professionals (ENV SP). Besides providing basic access to affordable transit services to get to jobs, housing, entertainment and schools, the Authority’s operations also intentionally advance regional social equity goals. • Equity in Transit: WMATA receives funding from federal government, which is used, among other purposes, to support equitable public transportation options and accessibility of services through initiatives such as a bus network redesign that will improve equitable access. • Green Jobs: In 2019, the Authority directly employed approximately 12,000 individuals in the region and indirectly more through contracting. • Procurement: The Authority has worked to expand opportunities for small businesses through the Small Business Program Office with the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program, Small Business Enterprise Program, Minority Business Enterprise, and Small Business Program. • Policing: Reform at the Metro Transit Police Department is ongoing. • Transit-Oriented Development (“TOD”): TOD is prioritized in capital projects to maximize community connections, accessibility, and positive economic impact. WMATA’s Smart TOD tool expands opportunities for partnerships by allowing individuals or developers to identify TOD opportunities. ALIGNMENT TO CLIMATE BONDS STANDARD AND CERTIFICATION SCHEME The Authority has engaged Kestrel Verifiers to provide an independent verification on the alignment of the Series 2021A Bonds with the Climate Bonds Standard (V3.0) and Certification Scheme, and the Transport sector criteria (Version 2). The Climate Bonds Initiative (the “CBI”) administers the Standard and sector criteria. Additionally, Kestrel Verifiers has examined alignment of the Series 2021A Bonds with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SDGs”). Kestrel Verifiers is a Climate Bonds Initiative Approved Verifier. The Kestrel review team included environmental scientists. We performed a Reasonable Assurance engagement to independently verify that the bonds meet, in all material respects, relevant criteria.,4 For this engagement, Kestrel Verifiers reviewed the Authority’s Green Bond Framework and relevant plans. We examined public and non-public information and interviewed members of the Authority’s Office of Sustainability, senior management, and finance teams. Our goal was to understand the planned use of proceeds, procedures for managing proceeds, and plans and practices for reporting in sufficient detail to verify the bond. Verifier’s Responsibilities Kestrel Verifiers’ responsibilities for confirming alignment of the Series 2021A Bonds with the Climate Bonds Standard and Transport criteria (V2) include: • assess and certify WMATA’s internal processes and controls, including selection process for projects and assets, internal tracking of proceeds, and the allocation system for funds; • assess policies and procedures established by WMATA for reporting; • assess the readiness of WMATA to meet the Climate Bonds Standard (V3.0) and Transport (Version 2) sector criteria; and • express a Reasonable Assurance conclusion. Relevant Climate Bonds Sector Criteria and Other Standards The Series 2021A Bonds align with the Climate Bonds Standard (V3.0) and Transport criteria (Version 2). Assurance Approach Kestrel Verifiers’ responsibility is to conduct a Reasonable Assurance engagement to determine whether the Series 2021A Bonds meet, in all material respects, the requirements of the Climate Bonds Standard. Our Reasonable Assurance was conducted in accordance with the Climate Bonds Standard (V3.0) and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000: Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information . Kestrel Verifiers has relied on information provided by the Authority. There are inherent limitations in performing assurance, and fraud, error or non-compliance may occur and not be detected. Kestrel Verifiers is not responsible or liable for any opinions, findings or conclusions that are incorrect. Our assurance is limited to the Authority’s policies and procedures in place as of May 2021. The distribution and use of this verification report are at the sole discretion of the Authority. Kestrel Verifiers does not accept or assume any responsibility for distribution to any other person or organization. Use of Proceeds and Conformance to Sector Criteria Proceeds of the Series 2021A Bonds will be used to finance capital improvement costs of the Authority established in the Six-Year Capital Improvement Program (“CIP”). Projects to be financed by the Series 2021A Bonds are diverse and all directly support the growth and maintenance of a high-quality public transportation system with low carbon emissions. The assets have not been nominated for other Green or Climate Bonds. Transportation accounts for 29% of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) in the U.S. and efficient, accessible public transportation systems are critical to transportation sector emission reductions.1 In fiscal year 2019, WMATA’s ridership offset an estimated 300,000 metric tons of GHG emissions. Besides offsetting emissions by providing more efficient transportation options, the Authority is actively designing and building electric bus ready infrastructure to support regional electrification and carbon reduction goals. 1 EPA: Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, 2019. https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions.,5 Projects in the CIP include, but are not limited to, acquisition of new railcars, upgrades to rail power infrastructure, signal and communication systems, bus system improvements, information technology upgrades. Ongoing monitoring and maintenance projects include track replacement, track circuit and power cable replacements, and station lighting and cooling improvements. Investment areas and anticipated CIP projects are included in Appendix A. A selection of major improvement projects in the CIP are highlighted below. • New 8000-Series railcars : Acquisition of 360 new railcars to replace outdated 2000 and 3000 Series fleet by 2024. • Traction power upgrades to support additional 8-car trains : Upgrades to rail power infrastructure, including multiple traction power substation equipment upgrades and regenerative breaking technology to increase system capacity and reliability. • Fare collection modernization : Replacement of fare collection systems in Metrobuses and in rail stations to improve efficiency and passenger experience. • Replacement of Bladensburg and Northern Bus Facilities : Demolition and replacement of existing bus maintenance and operations facilities to improve capacity and plan for the future electric bus fleet. The Bladensburg and Northern Bus facilities are designed to LEED Platinum standards. Projects in the CIP to be partially financed with the Series 2021A Bonds include projects subject to LEED Green Building Standards and projects that support Zero Emission Bus Fleet. LEED Green Building Standards: Multiple construction projects which may be partially financed by the Series 2021A Bonds will meet ambitious green building goals. In 2008, the Authority made a commitment to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) green building standards. New construction or buildings undergoing substantial renovations must meet, at a minimum, LEED Silver specifications. Nine projects have met LEED Silver or Gold standards and another eight are ongoing. Green infrastructure such as rain gardens and native plantings are part of the green building standards and the Authority’s commitment to environmental stewardship. Efficient water use is incorporated into transit stations, bus washes, and maintenance facilities. Stormwater best management practices are also key considerations in capital projects. Zero Emission Bus: Metro already operates a fully electrified rail system that is the second busiest rail transit system in the U.S. The Zero-Emission Bus Program announced in 2020 outlines the necessary prerequisites for the Authority’s transition to zero-emission bus technologies. The Authority is designing and building electric bus ready infrastructure to ensure a successful transition. Possible bond-financed activities include acquisition of buses, construction of electric-ready bus garages, planning and construction of infrastructure required for electrification, including grid upgrades and other bus facility improvements. Sector Criteria Transport Criteria (Version 2) The projects financed by the Series 2021A Bonds align with the CBI Transport Criteria (Version 2) under the Asset Classes Infrastructure and Buses. The majority of proceeds finance projects which fall under the definition, “Dedicated infrastructure for electrified public transport.” These projects meet eligibility of the sector criteria with no further disclosure required. A portion of the Series 2021A Bonds will finance Metrobus system improvements. The bus system upgrades to be partially financed by the Series 2021A Bonds will enable the system to have sufficiently low emissions intensity to meet the 2020 universal emissions intensity threshold (50 g CO2 per passenger-,6 km). The Authority released its Zero-Emission Bus Update in early 2020 where it committed to working with regional partners towards a cleaner transportation future. The Authority works across several jurisdictions with the majority of bus service provided in the District of Columbia. The 2018 Clean Energy DC Act proposes a fully electrified public transit fleet by 2045. Projects identified in the CIP lay groundwork for scalable transition to zero-emission bus technologies. Projects include bus garages designed for electric bus charging and maintenance and work with utilities to provide necessary charging infrastructure for significant changes in electricity demand. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection The projects financed by the Series 2021 Bonds advance the Authority’s sustainability goals and the larger region’s sustainability targets established by policy and legislation, including Washington DC’s goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 and make all public buses zero emission by 2045. The sustainability of WMATA’s system is also critical to goals established by other regional legislation such as Maryland’s Clean Energy Jobs Act and Virginia’s Clean Economy Act. The Authority’s Keeping Metro Safe, Reliable & Affordable Strategic Plan guides the annual budget development process. The annual budget, consisting of both the capital and operating budget, is prepared by senior management and submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. The CIP is developed in coordination with the annual budget. Project managers submit projects to the Capital Program Advisory Committee which reviews and prioritizes projects. Funding constraints are also evaluated. The Capital Planning Office, project implementation groups, engineering groups, and sustainability groups work together throughout the project selection process. Budget development and project selection also involves public participation through multiple channels, including public hearings, opportunities for comments and feedback, and rider surveys. The Public Participation Plan supports further outreach at community events, through local organizations, and through other opportunities to ensure fair participation of all communities. The Authority’s Energy Action Plan guides energy management and helps inform decision-making around project selection and prioritization. Resilience planning and the Envision Framework, which includes sustainable infrastructure design goals, are also expected to be more comprehensively incorporated into the project selection and implementation processes. The Authority also has multiple program-specific plans that articulate long-term visions and goals for each program. Bond-financed activities align with the Washington Area Bus Transformation Project and the Metrobus Fleet Plan which is currently being updated to reflect new and evolving zero-emission technologies. Management of Proceeds Proceeds of the Series 2021A Bonds will finance capital improvement projects and costs of issuance. Net proceeds of the Series 2021A Bonds will finance the projects described in the Use of Proceeds section above. Proceeds will be deposited into a fund held separately from other funds of the Authority and may temporarily be invested in accordance with the Compact. Eligible investments include, but are not limited to, US treasuries, agency securities, and top tier commercial paper and must comply with other restrictions, as outlined in the Compact.,7 Reporting The Authority reports metrics on sustainability-related achievements in two periodic reports. Progress on WMATA’s 2025 Energy Action Plan is reported in the Progress Report. The progress report includes accomplishments of previous years and articulates priority projects for subsequent fiscal years. It is expected that the reports will include an update on energy use per vehicle mile and progress towards the 2025 target. The Authority’s second relevant report is the Sustainability Report which outlines progress towards sustainability goals related to Livability & Accessibility, Economic Prosperity, and Environmental Impact. The Report includes systemwide environmental impact metrics associated with GHG emissions, energy use, and watershed stewardship, and waste reduction. WMATA expects to include a Green Bonds section in the Report which will list Green Bonds issued, net proceeds outstanding, and program categories which have received Green Bonds proceeds. Within 24 months of certification, Kestrel Verifiers will also provide one post-issuance Update Report to the Climate Bonds Initiative. This report will provide assurance that the Authority is conforming to all of the post-issuance requirements of the Climate Bonds Standard and that the projects continue to be in alignment with the Green Bonds Framework. It is expected to include information about CIP progress and system-wide impact. The Authority intends to post this report as a voluntary disclosure on the EMMA website, on their website: www.wmata.com, and may also be distributed on an investor relations page: www.wmatabonds.com. The Authority will also enter a continuing disclosure agreement (“CDA”) to provide disclosures to the MSRB so long as the Series 2021A Bonds are outstanding. The reporting will be done annually on the EMMA system operated by the MSRB. Disclosures provided by the Authority in the reports noted above or otherwise regarding sustainability or the expenditure of Series 2021A Bond proceeds on such projects will not be obligations of the Authority under the CDA but may be posted by the Authority on the EMMA system on a voluntary basis from time to time. Impact and Alignment with UN SDGs The Authority’s commitment to expansion of zero-emission, reliable and affordable public transportation systems supports the sustainable vision of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SDGs”). The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015 provides “a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet.” The United Nations’ Agenda describes 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The Series 2021A Bonds directly support UN SDGs 9 and 11 by expanding zero-and low-emission public transportation options. A comprehensive list of targets and background on UN SDG 9 and 11 is available on the United Nations’ website: https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/,8 UN SDG Green Category (SDG Targets)2 Possible Indicators ● Clean Transportation (Target 9.1) ● Number of people with access to sustainable transport systems ● Reduction in fossil fuel use as a result of bond projects ● Clean Transportation (Targets 11.2, 11.3, 11.6) ● Number of individuals with access to public transportation ● Avoided greenhouse gas emissions (tons CO2eq) ● Avoided air pollutant emissions (other than greenhouse gases) ● Number of avoided hospitalizations as a result of improved air quality CONCLUSION Based on the Reasonable Assurance procedures we have conducted, in our opinion, the Series 2021A Bonds conform, in all material respects, with the Climate Bonds Standard, and the bond-financed activities are aligned with the Transport sector criteria (Version 2). The Authority’s ambitious sustainability goals and forward-thinking planning for zero-emission transit infrastructure are exemplary and are integral to advancing regional GHG emission reduction goals.
