C O M / E S G 3 o f 2 2 Scope of work Alimentation Couche - Tard Inc. (“Couche - Tard” or “the issuer”) commissioned ISS ESG to assist with its Green Bond by assessing th ree core elements to determine the sustainability quality of the instrument : 1. Green Bond link to Couche - Tard ’s sustainability strategy – drawing on Couche - Tard ’s overall sustainability profile and issuance - speci fic Use of Proceeds categories. 2. Couche - Tard ’s Green Bond Framework ( April 2021 version) – benchmarked against the International Capital Market Association's ( ICMA ) Green Bond Principles (GBPs) . 3. The Selection Criteria – whether the projects contribute positively to the UN SDGs and perform against ISS ESG ’s issue - specific key performance indicators (KPIs) . ISS ESG ASSESSMENT SUMMARY 1 ISS ESG ’s evaluation is based on Couche - Tard’s Green Bond Framework (April 2021 version), on the analysed Selection Criteria, and on the ISS ESG Corporate Rating applicable at the SPO delivery date (updated on the 12.22.2020). SPO SECTION SUMMARY EVALUATION 1 Part 1 : Green Bond link to issuer’s sust ainability strategy According to the ISS ESG Corporate Rating published on 12 . 22 .2020, the issuer shows a moderate sustainability performance against the industry peer group on key ESG issues faced by the Retail sector . The issuer is rated 1 4 2 nd out of 254 companies within its sector . The Use of Proceeds financed through this bond are consistent with the issuer’s sustainability strategy and material ESG topics for the issuer’s industry. The rationale for issuing green bonds is clearly described by the issuer. Consistent with issuer’s sustainability strategy Part 2 : Alignment with GBPs Th e issuer has defined a formal concept for its Green Bond regarding use of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the GBPs . Positive Part 3 : Sustainability quality of the Selection Criteria The overall sustainability quality of the Selection Criteria in terms of sustainability benefits, risk avoidance and minimi z ation are good based upon the ISS ESG assessment. The Green Bond will (re - )finance eligible asset categories which include: clean tr ansportation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, pollution prevention and control, sustainable water and wastewater management, and green buildings. Those use of proceed s categories have a positive contribution to SDG 3 ‘Good health and well - being’ , SDG 6 ‘Clean water and sanitation’, SDG 7 ‘affordable and clean energy’, SDG 11 ‘Sustainable cities and communities’, SDG 12 ‘Responsible consumption and production’, SDG 13 ‘ Climate action’ and SDG 15 ‘Life on land’. The environmental and social risks associated with those use of proceeds categories have been well managed.

ASSESSMENT OF COUCHE - TARD ’S ESG PERFORMANCE The ISS ESG Corporate Rating provides material and forward - looking environmental, social and governance (ESG) data and performance assessments.

ESG performance As o f 1 2 . 2 2.20 2 1 , this r ating places Couche - Tard 142 nd out of 25 4 companies rated by ISS ESG in the Retail sector . Key c hallenges faced by companies in term s of sustainability management in this sector are displayed in the chart on the right, as well as the issuer’s performance against those key challenges in comparison to the average industry peers’ per formance. Sustainability Opportunities In the fiscal year 2020, Alimentation Couche - Tard generated 72% of its net sales from transportation fuels. Within the company's merchandise and services operations, which accounted for 27% of the total revenues, the major product groups are tobacco products (10.7% of total net sales), followed by beverages, food services, and beer/wine/liquor. Through its substantial sale of fuels, Alimentation Couche - Tard's product portfolio is not considered to be in line with tack ling global climate change. Besides, the company offers biofuels and electric car chargers to its customer, yet, there is no evidence that the company would actively promote cleaner fuel alternatives. Sustainability Risks In the retail sector, significant social risks exist in relation to the working conditions of their own staff as well as workers employed in the supply chain. Alimentation Couche - Tard has implemented general actions for non - discrimination and diversity as well as health and safety manageme nt. However, the,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d S el ec ti on C rit e ria I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 5 o f 2 2 company does not demonstrate adequate efforts to handle further relevant labor rights of their own staff (e.g. freedom of association). Besides, there is no evidence of coherent management of labor rights in the supply chain. And the compa ny does not seem to fulfill its responsibility toward customers : apart from initial measures to ensure food safety and nutritional targets of its food offering, there are no indications of efforts to ensure product safety and information security or to pro vide customers with comprehensive information on product characteristics and potential hazards. Regarding environmental topics, the company demonstrates basic steps to mitigate climate change risks and to increase the energy efficiency of retail buildings. Yet, energy use from large - scale transport activities is not yet addressed. Regarding the envir onmental footprint of products, in relation to fuels, most of the company's operations are bound by the legislation of where they operate (United States, Canada, and European Union), which set strict maximum content of sulfur in fuels. Apart from this, the re is no evidence that the company aims to further reduce the environmental impacts of fuels, e.g., offering liquid gas (LPG or CNG). For the rest of the products (mainly food and beverages), convincing measures to mitigate environmental impacts are not vi sible. Governance opinion The chair of Alimentation Couche - Tard's board (Mr. Alain Bouchard, as at September 24, 2020) is not independent, as he previously served as CEO of the company. The company's governance structure ensures effective supervision of m anagement: more than half of board members are independent and fully independent board committees responsible for audit, nomination and remuneration exist. The company discloses its policy for executive remuneration, which includes long - term incentive comp onents. Regarding the company's governance of sustainability, the company's Human Resources and Governance Board Committee is overseeing sustainability has been set up . Yet, ESG components do not seem to be integrated into the remuneration of the executiv e management team. Alimentation Couche - Tard's ethics code of conduct sets at least reasonable, partly even comprehensive, standards regarding most significant compliance topics, such as corruption and insider dealings. Comparatively comprehensive procedure s, such as anonymous and confidential reporting channels, are in place to enable the implementation of sound business ethics in practice. Sustainability impact of products and services portfolio Using a proprietary methodology, ISS ESG assessed the contribution of Couche - Tard ’s current products and services portfolio to the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations (UN SDGs). This analysis is limited to the evaluation of final product characteristic s and does not include practices along Couche - Tard ’s production process.

B. CONSISTENCY OF GREEN BOND WITH COUCHE - TARD ’S SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY Key sustainability objectives and priorities defined by the issuer In 2020, Couche - Tard identified four sustainability priorities, which have become increasingly important for the company’s stakeholders and business: fuel, energy, packaging and waste and workplace safety. For each of these four priorities, the company assigned an Executive Sponsor and set specific targets to achieve by 2025 and ambitions to aim towards by 2030: i. Fuel : o With the aim to be 10% greater than global legislation related to renewable fuel by 2030, Couche - Tard is committed to reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of the company’s total fuel offer by 12% by 2025 from 20 20. ii. Energy : o Anchored in the ambition for 30% of Couche - Tard’s sites to be carbon neutral by 2030, the company’s 2025 target is to reduce electricity consumption by an average of 20% per site from 20 20. iii. Packaging and Waste :,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d S el ec ti on C rit e ria I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 7 o f 2 2 o By 2030, Couche - Tard’s aspiration is for 100% of its packaging to be recyclable or reusable and aim to increase sustainable packaging in the com pany’s foodservice and private brand consumable products by 25% by 2025 from 20 20. iv. Workplace Safety : o Couche - Tard’s aspiration by 2030 is to cause zero harm for its people, customers and suppliers. For this reason, Couche - Tard’s goal is to decrease robberi es and recordable work - related injuries by 50% by 2025 from 20 20. Rationale for issu ance Through the issuance of the Green Bonds, Couche - Tard aim s to finance a low - carbon and sustainable future through expenditures that align with the company’s purpose to create a more resourceful world. The investments in the eligible categories will support the company’s efforts to achieve its sustainability targe ts in the areas of Fuel, Energy, and Packaging and Waste. Contribution of Use of Proceeds categories to sustainability objectives and priorities ISS ESG mapped the Use of Proceeds categories financed under this Green Bond Framework with the sustainability objectives defined by the issuer, and with the key ESG industry challenges as defined in the ISS ESG Corporate Rating methodology for the Retail sector . Key ESG industry challenges are key issues that are highly relevant for a respective industry to tackle when it comes to sustainability, e.g. climate change and energy efficiency in the buildings sector. From this mapping, ISS ESG derived a level of contribution to the strategy of each Use of Proceeds categories. USE OF PROCEEDS CATEGORY SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES FOR THE ISSUER KEY ESG INDUSTRY CHALLENGES CONTRIBUTION Clean Transportation ✓ ✓ Contribution to a material objective Energy Efficiency ✓ ✓ Contribution to a material objective Renewable Energy ✓ ✓ Contribution to a material objective Pollution Prevention and Control ✓ ✓ Contribution to a material objective Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management ✓ ✓ Contribution to a material objective Green Buildings ✓ ✓ Contribution to a material objective Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the Use of Proceeds financed through this bond are consistent with the issuer’s sustainability strategy and material ESG topics for the issuer’s industry. The rationale for issuing green bonds is clearly described by the issuer.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d S el ec ti on C rit e ria I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 8 o f 2 2 PART I I : ALIGNMENT WITH ICMA’ S GREEN BOND PRINCI PLES ( GBPS ) 1. Use of Proceeds We intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of any Green Bond issuances to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, one or more new or existing Eligib le Projects. “Eligible Projects” include expenditures made by us or any of our subsidiaries beginning with the issuance date of any Green Bonds, or in the 24 months prior to any such issuance. We will allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds as soon as practicable and, where feasible, aim to allocate a majority of the proceeds within the first 18 to 24 months after the issuance date of any Green Bonds. “Eligibility Criteria” are outlined below: GBP Category Eligible Projects and Examples Clean Transportation Expenditures that are designed to/expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation such as electric vehicle charging stations . Energy Efficiency Expenditures related to desig n, construction, operation, and maintenance of energy - efficient facilities and infrastructure including efficient HVAC, r oofs, energy management systems, LED lighting and upgrading refrigeration equipment that aim to achieve a 30% improvement in energy eff iciency . Renewable Energy Expenditures related to renewable energy projects including o n - site or off - si te solar , wind and small - scale hydropower generation with a capacity of fewer than 20 megawatts . Expenditures related to sourcing renewable fuels that is strictly limited to biofuels in compliance with EU legislation REDII plus rapeseed (canola). All biofuels are documented sustainable biofuels. 2 Pollution Prevention and Control Expenditures related to reduction of air em issions, greenhouse gas control and soil remediation , waste prevention including operational improvements, food waste recycling and minimization efforts , waste recycling including associated recycling infrastructure construction and operation and optimizing packaging for sustainability . 2 Regarding PFAD/soy certification, all biofuels purchased under the framework (including those which use PFAD as feedstock) are certified by an accredited body. For the avoidance of doubt, all biofuels purchased from external suppliers are compliant with RE DII and any other relevant national legislation. PFAD as feedstock to HVO might be up to 5% of Circle K Europe’s total HVO sales in 2021. Given Couche - Tard is not a producer of biofuels, rather sources biofuels, we will comply with all feedstock in compliance with RED I I Directive. Exclusion: crude palm and s oy will not be used as feedstock. PFAD/soy may be used as feedstock in pre - blended biodiesel. https://eur - lex.europa.eu/legal - content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.328.01.0082.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:328:TOC,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d S el ec ti on C rit e ria I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

Sustainable Water and Wastewa ter Management Expenditures related to water efficiency projects, such as efficiency in water used at our car washes, installation of new efficient water - related equipment, water recovery and recycling, wastewater management and water treatment in an effor t to improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminate dumping, minimize the release of hazardous chemicals and materials and increase recycling and safe water reuse . Green Buildings Expenditures related to real estate projects that have received or are expected to receive third - party sustainable certifica tions or verification, such as BREEAM Excellent+, Energy Star 85+, LEED Gold or Platinum , or equivalent certification. Expenditures may include: design, development, construction, materials, eq uipmen t and certification costs . Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Use of Proceeds description provided by Couche - Tard ’s Green Bond Framework as aligned with the GBPs . The eligible project categories are aligned with the issuer’s sustainability strategy. 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection A Green Bond Committee consisting of representatives from heads of relevant business units, Sustainability, and Treasury shall be responsible for the assessment and selection of Eligible Projects, on an annual basis, to ensure alignment with this Framework . In addition, all projects allocated funding from the issuance proceeds will follow an internal process that includes final review and approval by the CFO. The Green Bond Committee will also be responsible for identifying and managing potential ESG risks associated with eligible projects. Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Process for Project Evaluation and Selection description provided by Couche - Tard ’s Green Bond Framework as aligned with the GBPs . The issuer has a structured process to identify eligible projects and ESG risks associated with the eligible projects . Moreover, the issuer h as set up a Green Bond Committee comprised of relevant stakeholders , which is considered best market practice. 3. Man agement of Proceeds The Finance and Accounting department s will track an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of any Green Bonds allocated to Eligible Project . Pending allocation, an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of any Green Bon ds may be temporarily invested in cash, cash equivalents, and/or held in accordance with our internal liquidity policy.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d S el ec ti on C rit e ria I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 0 o f 2 2 In the case of divestment or if a project no longer meets the eligibility criteria listed above, we intend to reallocate the funds to other Eligible Expenditures. Any payment of principal and interest on any Green Bonds will be made from Couche - Tard’s general account and will not be linked to the performance of any Eligible Expenditures. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that Management of Proceeds proposed by Couche - Tard ’s Green Bond Framework is well aligned with the GBPs . All proceeds will be tracked in an appropriate manner. Moreover, the intended types of temporary placement for the balance of unallocated net p roceeds have been disclosed. 4. Reporting Allocation Reporting Annually, until all the proceeds have been fully allocated, and on a timely basis in case of material developments, Couche - Tard will publish a Green Bond Report, on its website [ https://corpo.couche - tard.com/en/investors/ sustainable - finance ], which will include (i) the amount of net proceeds allocated to each Eligible Project; (ii) project portfolio reporting on expected impact metrics, where feasibl e; (iii) a selection of brief project descriptions; and (iv) the outstanding amount of net proceeds to be allocated to Eligible Green Projects at the end of the reporting period.

C O M / E S G 1 7 o f 2 2 ANNEX 1 : Methodology ISS ESG Green KPIs The ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs serve as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality – i.e. the social and environmental added value – of the use of proceeds of Couche - Tard ’s Green Bond . It comprises firstly the definition of the use of proceeds category offering added social and/or environmental value, and secondly the specific sustainab ility criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the assets can be clearly identified and described. The sustainability criteria are complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measuremen t of the sustainability performance of the assets and which can also be used for reporting. If a majority of assets fulfill the requirement of an indicator, this indicator is then assessed positively. Those indicators may be tailor - made to capture the cont ext - specific environmental and social risks. To review the KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Federico Pezzolato (details below) who will send them directly to you. Environmental and social risks assessment methodology ISS ESG evaluates whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eligible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bond KPIs. All percentages refer to the amount of assets within one category (e.g. wind power). Additionally, the assessment “no or limited information is available” either indicates that no information was made available to ISS ESG or that the information provided did not fulfil the requirements of the ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs. The evaluation was carried out using information and documents pro vided to ISS ESG on a confidential basis by Couche - Tard (e.g. Due Diligence Reports). Further, national legislation and standards, depending on the asset location, were drawn on to complement the information provided by the issuer. Assessment of the contri bution and association to the SDG The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed in September 2015 by the United Nations and provide a benchmark for key opportunities and challenges toward a more sustainable future. Using a proprietary method, I SS ESG identifies the extent to which Couche - Tard ’s Green Bond contributes to related SDGs.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d S el ec ti on C rit e ria I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .
