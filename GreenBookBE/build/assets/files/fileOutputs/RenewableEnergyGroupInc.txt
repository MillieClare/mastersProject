( “ REG ” , or the “Company”) is North America’s largest producer of advanced biofuels . Headquartered in Ames, Iowa, REG employs more than 800 people and produced over 500 million gallons of biofuels in 2019 in the United States and Europe . REG has developed the REG Green Bond Framework (the “ F ramework ”) under which it intends to issue green bond ( s ) and use the proceeds to finance and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, the expansion of its Geismar facility which produces renewable diesel fuel . REG engaged Sustainalytics to review the REG Green Bond Framework , dated April 2021 , and provide a S econd - P arty O pinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) . 1 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 2 Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent 3 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • T he Framework’s al ignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA ; • The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and • The alignment of the issuer ’ s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in r elation to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.6, w hich is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sus tainalytics held conversations with various members of REG ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. REG repr esentatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of REG to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and (3) that any provi ded material information has been duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with t hat Framework. Any update of the present Second - Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and REG . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with mark et standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with b ond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the inten ded allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or argument , either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ . 2 The REG Green Bond Framework is available on REG ’s website at : http://regi.com/green - bond . 3 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustai nalytics and ensuring analyst indepen dence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust conflict m anagement framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consistency of process, structural separation of commercial and research (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparen cy.,Second - Party Opinion REG Green Bond Framework 3 or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that REG has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second - Pa rty Opinion . Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the REG Green Bond Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the REG Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the GBP . Susta inalytics highlights the following elements of REG ’ s G reen B ond F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible project defined in the Framework is aligned with th e project categories recognized by the GBP , namely renewable e nergy . - The proceeds of REG’s green bond will be dedicated to the expansion of its existing Geismar renewable diesel production facility in Louisiana. Specifically, the new initiative will expand its existing production capacity (“Train B”) , using the same technol ogy as the current “Train A”. This development will allow the production of 250 million gallons per year (MMGY) of renewable diesel, in addition to the current capacity of 90 MMGY. - The output of the financed facility will be renewable diesel, 4 a low - carbon fuel which is primarily used in transportation applications. Renewable diesel is particularly valuable as it can be used as a direct substitute for conventional petroleum di esel without any modification to engine t echnology. ▪ Renewable diesel may be produced from a variety of feedstocks. 100% of planned feedstock s will consist of waste products including animal residues (beef tallow, pork grease , and other animal fat s), used cooking oil, and distiller’s corn oil. 5 The Geismar facility is outfitted with a specialized pretre atment system allowing its use of low - quality or high - impurity feedstocks. Sustainalytics considers th is intended use of wast e products to help ensure the sustainability of feedstock sourcin g. ▪ The lifecycle emissions intensity of renewable d iesel varies based on the feedstocks selected, as well as the technical specifications of its production and various other supply chain factors . 6 REG has disclosed that the renewable diesel they intend to produce at the financed facility is expected to have an average intensity of approximately 35 gCO 2 e/MJ . 7 This represents a 65% reduction f rom petroleum diesel (100.45 gCO 2 e/MJ 8 ) . REG also notes that it intends to continue to use lower - carbon feedstocks going forward, and that across its biodiesel and renewable diesel operations its “best - in - class” fuel has an intensity of 12 gCO 2 e/MJ (88% improvement against fossil fuel comparator). • Project Evaluation and Selection: - The Fra mework states that the proceeds of REG’s green bond will be used solely to finance the expansion of its Geismar facility. Sustainalytics considers this disclosure to remove the necessity of defining a process for evaluation and selection, and therefore to be aligned with market expectations. • Management of Proceeds: - RE G has charged its executive and finance teams with responsibility for tracking the allocation of green bond proceeds to the eligible project. 4 90% of the fuel produced by the plant will be renewable diesel. The remaining share consists of approximately equally parts N aphtha and Liquid Petroleum Gas. These coproducts have similar carbon intensities to the primary renewable diesel product. 5 Distiller’s corn oil is a waste by - product from the distillation of ethanol (or other alcohols). 6 According the pathways modeled by the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), approved feedstocks may have emissions inte nsities ranging from 16.89 to 7 8.6 gCO 2 e /MJ . See: https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/documents/lcfs - pathway - certified - carbon - intensities 7 35 gCO 2 e /MJ is equivalent to 126 gCO 2 e / kWh. Sustainalytics notes that 100 gCO 2 e /MJ is generally considered a threshold within the green bond market for considering an energy source to be green. Nevertheless, in the context of this project, it is recognized that these biofu els result in substantial saving against the fossil fuel baseline , and that the deviation from the best practice threshold is not substantial. 8 This value is the approved figure per the LCFS,Second - Party Opinion REG Green Bond Framework 4 - The Framework discloses that the proceeds will be deployed within the 2021 , 2022 and 2023 calendar years, as the construction of the Geismar facility occurs ; t he Company intends th is facility to be operational by late 2023. Pending allocation proceeds will be held in cash or liquid instruments, or used to repay past indebtedness. - Based on the disclosure of responsible parties, as well as the commitment to an allocation timeline , Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Reporting: - REG intends to provide annual updates, made available on its website, on the allocation of proceeds to eligible projects , including information on discrete expenditures . - In regards to impact reporting, the Framework states that reporting will include GHG emissions avoided and total re newable diesel production. In addition, REG intends to continue to develop and provide other sustainability impact metrics at the company level in its Environmental, Social and Governance report , available on its website . - Based on the commitment to annual allocation and impact reporting, including the intent to report on the amount of low - carbon fuel produced and avoided emissions , Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that the REG Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP . For detailed information , please refer to Appendix 1 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Performance of REG Contribution of framework to Renewable Energy Group, Inc. ’s sustainability strategy Sustainalytics is of the opinion that investments planned under this Framework are a core component of REG’s strategy to expand manufacturing capacity of renewable diesel , and that this strategy will in turn deliver environmental benefits through expanding the use of low - carbon fuels . The Company considers renewable diesel as its largest growth generator and expects a significant uptick in demand in the medium term. The Geismar facility is the only facility where the Company currently manufactures renewable diesel and the intended expansion is a critical component of REG’s plan to nearly triple renewable diesel manufacturing capaci ty from the current 90 MMGY to ~ 340 MMGY by 2025. 9 REG considers sustainability to be central to its mission as it is engaged in the business of converting fats and oils into cleaner fuels such as biodiesel and renewable diesel with a significantly better emissions profile than fossil fuels. Sustainalytics considers that further investments in expanding manufacturing capacity could increase the supply of low - carbon fuel alternatives in the market while also incr easing recycling options for waste generated in other sectors. In recognition of its contribution and significance to a transition to clean energy, Corporate Knights named REG to its Clean200 list of publicly traded firms that are developing solutions to h ave a positive impact on the planet. 10 Accordingly, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the REG Green Bond Framework is aligned with the company’s overall sustainability strategy and initiatives and will further the Company’s action on its key environmen tal priorities. Well - positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the net proceeds from the bond issued under the Framework will be directed towards a project recognized by the GBP to have positive environmental impact, Sustainalytics is aware that it could also be associated with negative environmental and social outcomes . Some key environmental and social risks associated with the project could include occupational health and safety concerns at the manufacturing facility, air and water pollution from its productions process, as well as any environmental or social impacts related to its feedstocks . Sustainalytics is of the opinion that REG is able to man age and/or mitigate potential risks through implementation of the following: 9 Framework 10 Corporate Knights, The Carbon Clean200: Leading transition to a clean energy future, published February 2020 at: https://www.corporateknights.com/reports/2020 - clean - 200/2020s - carbon - clean200 - top - 200 - leading - transition - clean - energy - future - 15815808/,Second - Party Opinion REG Green Bond Framework 5 • Regarding health and safety , the Company has the following mitigation mechanisms in place: o In line with its VisionZero program aimed at achieving a performance of zero injuries, environmental or process incidents, each facility develops an Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) matrix to track activities with EHS implications, monitor progress, evaluate performance and is periodically shared internally. This is supplemented by var ious internal policies including REG’s EHS Policy that delineates responsibility to each employee and contractor to work safely, in accordance with policies, and stop work if there is a perceived safety concern. 11 , 12 o F rom beginning of 2014 through September 30, - 20 20 , REG demonstrate d a 63 % reduction in safety incidents to a total incident rate of 0. 92 per 200,000 work hours. This is an above average performance in the chemical manufacturing sector as per the average reported by the Bureau o f Labor Statistics. 13 o The Company also has safety training programs for its employees customized to the requirements of their jobs, Safety Committees at each location to educate and make safety applicable to daily work, and SEE Signals which are spotlights installed at each facility that function as a safety reminder to all employees . 14 • REG has submitted an air quality permit application to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality ( LDEQ ) and anticipates the permit for the facility with additional capacity to show as “minor” for federal air rules . Further, REG also intends on filing a permit with Louisiana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (LPDES) that will permit discharge from the facility. • REG complies with the “ food THEN fuel” philosophy for sourcing raw materials for production. The m ajority of the feedstock used are wastes , which include animal fats, vegetable oils, and used cooking oil which are by - products of processes such as meat production, human consumpti on, or cooking. Based on these policies, standards and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that REG has implemented adequate measures and is well - positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible categories. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds Increasing the share of biofuels to accelerate the transition to clean energy in transportation. The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) em issions in the United States 15 . In 2018, it was the highest GHG contributor accounting for 28% of total US GHG emissions, with the CO 2 emissions from this sector resulting primarily from burning fossil fuels for cars, trucks, commercial aircraft, and railr oads, of which light - duty vehicles were the most significant accounting for 59% of GHG emissions. Moreover between 1990 and 2018, GHG emissions in the transportation sector increased more in absolute terms than any other sector 16 . US federal and state gov ernment s ha ve enacted policies in an effort to reduce GHG emissions and expand the nation’s renewable fuels sector while reducing reliance on imported oil . 17 This has been done most prominently through the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and the California L ow - Carbon Fuel Standard. 18 Under the RFS, biodiesel and renewable diesel must meet a 50% lifecycle GHG emissions reduction as compared to a 2005 petroleum baseline 19 . It is also noted that the International Energy Agency has estimated that annual 11 REG , Social Responsibility at: https://www.regi.com/about/our - sustainability/social - responsibility 12 REG , EHS Policy at: https://www.regi.com/docs/default - source/uspubl icdocuments/reg_ehs_policy.pdf?sfvrsn=fe0b1612_2 13 REG , ESG Report 2019 at: https://www.regi.com/docs/default - source/default - document - library/reg_esg _report_2019.pdf 14 REG , Social Responsibility at: https://www.regi.com/about/our - sustainability/social - responsibility 15 EPA, Fast Facts on Transportation Greenhouse Gas Emissions (2020), at https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast - facts - transportation - greenhouse - gas - emissions 16 EPA, Fast Facts US Transportation Sector Greenhouse Gas Emissions 1990 - 2018 (2020), at https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P100ZK4P.pdf 17 EPA, Carbon Pollution from Transpor tation (2020), at https://www.epa.gov/transportation - air - pollution - and - climate - change/carbon - pollution - transportation 18 Sustainalytics note s that while other state - level regulatory schemes are currently operational or in development, at this time the LCFS remains the most important standard - setter in this sector. 19 EPA, Overview for Renewable Fuel Standard (2020), at https://www.epa.gov/renewable - fuel - standard - program/overview - renewable - fuel - standard,Second - Party Opinion REG Green Bond Framework 6 biofuel p roduction in the US needs to increase by 7% by 2030 to be on track with the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) 20 . Renewable diesel is a transportation fuel that is chemical ly the same as petroleum diesel and may be used in its pure form (R100) or mixed with petro leum diesel 21 . Renewable diesel is di stinct from biodiesel , having different physical properties and fuel specifications , which enable s it to be used as a direct substitute for petroleum diesel ( a “drop - in” fuel) and is produced through a very different process. While biodiesel is produced via transesterification , 22 renewable diesel uses processes such as hydrotreating/isomerization, gasi fication, pyrolysis, and other thermochemical and biochemical means. Renewable diesel qualifies as an advanced biofuel under the RFS . 23 Sustainalytics notes positively that the average REG biofuel achieves a 6 5 % CO 2 reduction vs petroleum diesel 24 . REG wi ll use the proceeds to fund the construction of a new plant focused on the production of renewable diesel at Geismar, Louisiana. This plant will add 250 MMGY to the existing plant’s 90 MMGY of operating capacity. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that this project is therefore impactful and could support the transition to clean energy in transportation in the US. Alignment with/ contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainabl e development by the year 2030. This green bond advances the following SDG and targets: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Renewable Energy 7. Affordable and clean energy 9 . Industry, innovation and infrastructure 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. 9.4 By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource - use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound tec hnologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities Conclusion REG has developed the R EG Green Bond Framework under which it will issue green bonds and the use of proceeds to finance its expansion of the Geismar renewable diesel production facility . Sustainalytics considers that the project funded by the green bond proceeds will provide positive environmental impact through its production of low - carbon fuels . The REG Green Bond Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the us e of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the REG Green Bond Framework is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use of proceed s will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goa ls 7 and 9 . Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that REG has adequate measures to ide ntify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Renewable Energy Group, Inc. is well - positioned to issue green bonds and that th e REG Green Bond Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018. 20 IEA, Transport Biofuels (2020), at https://www.iea.org/reports/transport - biofuels 21 EIA, Biofuels explained, biomass - based diesel fuels (2020), at https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biofuels/biodiesel - in - depth.php 22 Transesterif ication is a chemical process that converts fats and oils into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) 23 EIA, Biofuels explained, biomass - based diesel fuels (2020), at https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biofuels/biodiesel - in - depth.php 24 REG , ESG Report 2019 at: https://www.regi.com/docs/default - source/default - document - library/reg_esg_report_2019.pdf,Second - Party Opinion REG Green Bond Framework 7 Append i ces Append ix 1 : Green B ond / Green Bond Programme - External Review Form Section 1.

Second - Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second - Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second - Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of proje cts intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with inte rnal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s intern al tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may v erify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scena rio. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion REG Green Bond Framework 12 Disclaimer Copyright ©2020 Sustainalytics.
