C O M / E S G 3 o f 1 5 Overall Evaluation of the Green Bond Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) commissioned ISS ESG to assist with its Green Bond by assessing th ree core elements to determine the sustainability quality of the Bond: 1. AFC’s Green Bond framework – benchmarked against the International Capital Market Asso ciation's ( ICMA ) Green Bond Principles (GBPs ). 2. The asset pool – whether the projects aligned with ISS ESG ’s issue - specific key performance indicators (KPIs) (See Annex 2 ). ISS ESG ASSESSMENT SUMMARY 1 ISS ESG ’s present evaluation will remain valid until any modification of the Green Bond Framework or addition of new assets into the asset pool by the issuer. The controversy check of the underlying assets has been conducted on the 03.09.2020 SPO SECTION SUMMARY EVALUATION 1 Part 1: Performance against GBPs The issuer has defined a fo rmal concept for its Green Bond regarding use of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the ICMA GBPs. Positive Part 2: Sustainability quality of the asset pool The overall sustainability quality of the asset pool in terms of sustainability benefits, risk avoidance a nd minimisation is good based on the ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs. The Green Bond KPIs contain a clear descript ion of eligible asset categories which include: wind energy and hydroelectric energy. All assets of the asset pool are located in develop ing countries (Ivory Coast, Cap e Verde, Djibouti) . Risks potentially relate to adverse social, environmental and govern ance impacts in financed activities despite these being actively mitigated by the issuer . Positive Part 3: Issuer indicative s ustainability performance The issuer intends to secure a full ESG Corporate Rating in the near term. The Corporate Rating will be communicated by the issuer Not applicable,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 4 o f 1 5 Contribution of the Green Bond to the UN SDGs Based on the assessment of the sustainability quality of the green bond asset pool and using a proprietary methodology, ISS ESG a ssessed the contribution of AFC’s green bond to the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations (UN SDGs). This assessment is displayed on a 5 - point scale (see Annex 2 for meth odology): Significant Obstruction Limited Obstruction No Net Impact Limited Contribution Significant Contribution Each of the bond’ s Use of Proceeds categories has been assessed for its contribution to, or obstruction of, the SDGs: USE OF PROCEEDS CONTRIBUTION OR OBST RUCTION SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPM ENT GOALS Wind Power Significant Contribution Hydroelectric Power Limited Contribution,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 5 o f 1 5 ISS ESG SPO ASSESSMENT PART I: GREEN BOND PRINCIPLES 1. Use of Proceeds The net proceeds raised from the AFC Green Bonds will be allocated to finance (or refinance) eligible projects as outlined below. Eligible projects will contribute to one or more of the high - level objectives of the Green Bond Principles. Select ed eligible green projects ar e shown below: Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Use of Proceeds description provided by AFC ’s Green Bond Framework as complete and aligned with the GBPs . Environmental benefits associated with the use of proceeds category are described. 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection AFC’s definition of a Green Project AFC defines green projects as any mitigation or adaptation project that focus es on reducing carbon emissions or increasing resilience. Examples of the types of projects AFC considers eligible include the following: ▪ Energy Generation and Access through renewable energy sources (solar, hydro and wind) ; ▪ New transport technologies, incl uding the use of alternative fuels, more efficient engines, and electric and hybrid technologies. More sustainable approaches to urban transport and infrastructure planning can have a huge impact on future emissions trajectories ; ▪ Reducing emissions from de forestation and forest degradation ; ▪ Energy efficiency and the adoption of lower emission sources of energy for industries ; ▪ Efforts to reduce emissions from energy, transport, and cities and the creation of resilient infrastructure systems such as integrated water supply systems. AFC Sector ICMA GBP Example projects Power Renewable Energy Inst a llation of wind farms to support energy independence, displacing liquid fuel plants. Hydroelectric power plants to increase power capacity and reduce generation costs. Solar power projects encompassing production, transmission and maintenance. Transport & Logistics Clean transportation Clean transportation such as electrification of public transport and railways as well as transportation such as toll roads that decong est urban cities and reduce commuting time.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 6 o f 1 5 Selection Process All projects under consideration for green bond financing undergo an assessment process on the basis of the AFC Investment Policy which includes consideration with regards to a) Efficiency and effectiv eness: this reflects economic potential / bankability of the project b) Impact potential: this reflects the level of impact with regards to reducing emissions or increasing resilience; and c) S ustainable development potential: this reflects the wider long - term development impact as it relates to E&S, gender etc. Examples of some of the SDGs that may be addressed include SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation an d Infrastructure). Phase 1: A project is identified as being green (in accordance with the definition above) at the origination stage Phase 2: Green projects are appraised in accordance with AFC’s internal investment process Phase 3: Approved projects will become eligible for inclusion in the Green Bond program Phase 4: If there is a need to replace any project on the list of potential projects, AFC may change it and find a substitute project that meets the eligibility criteria. Opinion: ISS ESG con siders the Process for Project Evaluation and Selection description provided by AFC’s Green Bond Framework as complete and aligned with the Green Bond Framework . Moreover, the issuer has established a structured process to determine that projects fit withi n defined categories, reflecting good market practices. 3. Management of Proceeds Every project under the Green Bond Program is subject to AFC’s portfolio monitoring under AFC’s Investment Policy. AFC’s portfolio management approach includes control and monitoring of disbursements, operation status and contractual compliance, client and operation credit risk. In addition, disbursements for projects under the Green Bond Program are monitored by the Assets and Liability Committee (ALCO) in order to ensure the proper use of the Green Bond proceeds. AFC intends to allocate the proceeds from green debt financing instruments to a portfolio of Eligible Projects, selected in accordance with the use of proceeds criteria and project evaluation and selection process presented above. AFC intends to allocate t he proceeds within a year. AFC will endeavor to achieve a level of allocation for the eligible green project portfolio which matches the balance of net proceeds from its outstanding green debt financing instruments. Additional eligible green projects will be added to the issuer’s eligible green project portfolio to the extent required to ensure that the net proceeds from outstanding green debt financing instruments will be allocated to eligible green projects. Any unallocated proceeds will be earmarked a nd held as cash or in AFC’s Treasury Liquidity Portfolio pending investment in Eligible Projects in accordance with ICMA’s Green Bond Principles. Green Bond Program Proceeds Monitoring The net proceeds from any AFC Green Bond issuances will be managed wi thin AFC’s treasury liquidity portfolio ahead of distribution to the eligible projects selected. For the duration of the Green Bond’s life, AFC will track the outstanding balance of the net proceeds and reconcile against allocations made to eligible green projects,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 7 o f 1 5 over the time horizon. AFC will manage any unallocated proceeds from green bond issuances in accordance with the Green Bond Principles. A selected project can be in one of the following three stages: i) New projects that have been approved and meet all the requirements in order to start the disbursement period ; ii) Projects that are already in the disbursement period ; iii) Projects that have finished receiving disbursements and are either in their grace period or have begun to amortize, but still have a relev ant amount in AFC’s portfolio pending amortization. Given that every individual project selected for the program has different characteristics including tenor, disbursement period, grace period and amortization schedule, cashflow mismatches when compared to the characteristics of the bonds are common. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that Management of Proceeds proposed by AFC is well aligned with the GBPs as the green bond proceeds will be tracked in an appropriate manner by the issuer. Additionally, AFC has established a procedure in case of divestment or postponement, reflecting best market practices. 4. Reporting AFC will provide investors with repor ting on the allocation of proceeds until proceeds have been fully allocated and the impact of eligible green projects on an annual basis for the duration of the Green Bonds. Data will be collected and reported at the project level using a data collection t ool developed by the AFC and facility documents will include contractual clauses for annual ESG and Development Impact reporting to AFC. Allocation Reporting The allocation report provides: • The total amount of investments in the Eligible Green Projects Portfolio • The amounts of new and existing projects • The balance of unallocated proceeds Impact Reporting AFC will report on the environmental impact of the projects funded with the Green Bonds proceeds or refer to existing sustainability reporting (withi n or outside of the Annual Report). Listed below are potential environmental impact indicators . Potential Impact Indicators: • Capacity of renewable energy plant(s) built o r rehabilitated (MW) • Passenger - kilometres (i.e. the transport of one passenger over one kilometre) and/or passengers; or tonne kilometres (i.e. the transport of one tonne over one kilometre) and/or tonnes • Annual GHG emissions reduced/avoided in tCO 2 – e p.a. • Annual Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduced or avoided (tCO 2 e). Depending on the type of project, a relevant GHG emission factor will be applied to activity data, such as: annual energy savings (MWh) or annual renewable energy produced (MWh) • Minimum ene rgy efficiency improvement achieved (%) • Annual additional energy capacity (kW) • Annual GHG emissions avoided (tons of CO 2 eq),S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

C O M / E S G 1 3 o f 1 5 ANNEX 1 : Methodo logy ISS ESG Green KPIs The ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs serves as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality – i.e. the social and environmental added value – of the use of proceeds of AFC’s Green Bond. It comprises firstly the definition of the use of proceeds category offering added social and/or environmental value, and secondly the specific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the a ssets can be clearly identified and described. The sustainability criteria are complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measurement of the sustainability performance of the assets and which can also be used for reporting. Those indic ators may be tailor - made to capture the context - specific environmental and social risks. To review the KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Federico Pezzolato (details below) who will send them directly to you. Asset evaluation methodology ISS ESG evalua tes whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eligible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bond KPIs. All percentages refer to the amount of assets within one category (e.g. wind power). Additionally, the assessment “no or limi ted information is available” either indicates that no information was made available to ISS ESG or that the information provided did not fulfil the requirements of the ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs. The evaluation was carried out using information and documents provided to ISS ESG on a confidential basis by AFC (e.g. Due Diligence Reports). Further, national legislation and standards, depending on the asset location, were drawn on to complement the information provided by the issuer. Assessment of the contributi on and association to the SDG The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed in September 2015 by the United Nations and provide a benchmark for key opportunities and challenges toward a more sustainable future. Using a proprietary method, ISS E SG identifies the extent to which AFC’s Green Bond contributes to related SDGs.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su sta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Gr e en Bon d A s s et Poo l I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .
