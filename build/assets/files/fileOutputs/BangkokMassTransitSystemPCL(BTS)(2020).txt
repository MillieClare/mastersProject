© Sustainalytics 201 9 Second - Party Opinion BTSG Green Bond Framework Evaluation Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the BTS G Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018 and ASEAN Green Bond Standards 2018 . This assessment is based on the following: The eligible category for the use of proceeds , Clean transportation and supporting infrastructure , is aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond Pri nciples and ASEAN Green Bond Standards 2018 . Sustainalytics considers that the development of public clean transportation and related infrastructure will lead to positive environmental impacts by supporting low carbon mobility in Bangkok . Sustainalytics considers that the E ligible Green Assets will advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 11. BTSG’s Eligible Green Assets are evaluated and selec ted by its dedicated Green Bond Working Group (GBWG) based on the established eligibility criteria. The G B WG consists of cross - functional representatives from the Treasury Department, Corporate Communication Department, Service Planning and MIS Department and Finance team of the project(s) . The selected projects are then approved by the C ompany’s Executive Committee. This process is aligned with market practices . The pro ceeds of the bonds will be segregated into separate accounts within BTSG’s finance and reporting system and tracked using BTSG’s internal information systems, which is managed by its a ccounting team . Pending full allocation, the unallocated proceeds will b e ; (i) invested in cash and cash equivalents ; (ii) invested in short and liquid marketable securities and/or , (iii) applied to temporarily reduce indebtedness of a revolving nature. BTSG intends to fully allocate within 2 4 months from the bond issuance date. This process is in line with market practices. BTSG intends to report annually on the allocation and impact of proceeds on the C ompany’s website until full allocation of the bond s . Allocation reporting will include the balance amount of allocated and unallocated net proceeds as well as the summary of projects while t he impact reporting will include relevant impact metrics , i.e. number of passenger s per year and amount of CO 2 emission reduction s per year. The scope and frequency of allocation and impact reporting is aligned with market practice.

Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the green categories under the BTSG Green Bond Framework align with the ASEAN Green Bond Standards.,Second - Party Opinion BTSG Green Bond Framework 2 Introduction BTS Group Holdings PCL (“BTSG” or the “Company”) operates mass transit, media, property and service businesses in Thailand. BTSG’s m ass transit unit , which accounts for the majority of the group’s revenue s , operates and maintains the Sky Train system, an elevated trackwork in Bangkok, covering 36 kilometers of train tracks , and the Bus Rapid Transit system with 12 stations through 15 kilometers of ded icated bus lane. BTSG was founded in 1968 and is headquartered in Bangkok, Thailand. BTSG has developed the BTSG Green Bond Framework (the “ F ramework ”) under which it intends to issue green bonds and use the proceeds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and f uture projects that contribute to development of electrified transportation services and related - infrastructures (“Eligible Green Assets”) while supporting the C ompany’s strategy and vision . The F ramework defines one eligibility crit eri on: 1. Clean transportation and supporting infrastructure BTSG engaged Sustainalytics to review the BTSG Green Bond Framework , dated October 2020 1 and provide a second - party opinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) 2 and the ASEAN Green Bond Standards 2018 ( AGBS ) 3 . This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 4 Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent 5 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalyt ics assessed the following: • T he Framework’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA and the ASEAN Green Bonds Standards, as administered by the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum; • The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; • The alignment of the issuer ’ s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1. 5, which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of OPMB ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. OPMB representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of OPMB to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a ti mely manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. 1 This SPO is a slightly revised version of a previous SPO produced by Sustainalytics (dated April 2019). It has been updated to incorporate (I) two additional temporary allocation methods; (ii) exclusionary criteria; and (iii) more recent information on BTSG’s sustainability strategy. The changes are in no way material to Sustainalytics’ opinion re garding the benefits of the intended use of bond proceeds or the Framework’s alignment with the GBP. 2 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ 3 The ASEAN Green Bond Standards are administered by the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum and are ava ilable at : https://www.theacmf.org/initiatives/sustainable - finance/asean - green - bond - standards 4 The BTSG Green Bond Framework is available on BTSG’s website at: http://www.btsgroup.co.th/en/sustainability/green - bond 5 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustai nalytics and ensuring analyst independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust con flict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consistency of proc ess, structural separation of commercial and research (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is int egrity, another is transparency.,Second - Party Opinion BTSG Green Bond Framework 3 Any update of the present Second - Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and BTSG . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds b ut does not measure the actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the intended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or argument either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that BTGS has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second - Party Opinion .,Second - Party Opinion BTSG Green Bond Framework 4 Sustainal ytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the BTSG Green Bond Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the BTSG Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 201 8 and the ASEAN Green Bonds Standard . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of BTSG’ s G reen B ond F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible use of categor y of the BTSG Green Bond Framework – Clean transportation and supporting infrastructure – is recognized as impactful by the Green Bond Principles 2018 and the ASEAN Green Bond Standard . Sustainalytics believes BTSG’s electrified mass transportation projects contribute to a reduction in Bangkok’s GHG footprint through assisting the shift to wards public and low - carbon mobility . - Sustainalytics views BTSG’s two - year look - back period for refinancing activities as aligned with market practices. In addition, BTSG confirmed that at least half of the proceeds will be allocated within one year while full allocation will be completed after two year s from the issuance . In accordance with Climate Bond s Standard version 3 . 0 , 6 S ustainalytics considers BTSG’s settlement period of net proceeds as being aligned with market best practice . - BTSG confirmed that the eligibility criteria for clean transportation and supporting infrastructure include investments in electr ic - powered vehicles only. - The exclusionary criteria outlined in the Framework exclude the following: exploration, production or transportatio n of fossil fuel; generation of nuclear power; activities/projects associated with child labor/forced labor. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that these exclusions strengthen the Framework. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - According to BTSG’s three - step project evaluation and selection process, a pool of E ligible Green Assets is identified and evaluated by its Green Bond Working Group (GBWG) based on the established eligibility criteria. The GBWG consists of cross - functional representatives from Treasury Department, Corporate Communication Department, Service Planning and MIS Department and Finance team of the project(s) . After the evaluation process, final Eligible Green Assets are reviewed and approved by the C ompany’s Executive Committee . Follo wing the approval, the Executive Committee notifies BTSG’s Board of Directors regarding the selected projects. T his process is aligned with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - BTSG will segregate the green bond proceeds into separate accounts within BTSG’s finance and reporting system , under the management of its a ccounting team . Pending full allocation, the unallocated proceeds may be (i) held in cash or cash equivalents; (ii) invested in short and liquid marketable securities which are not inconsistent with the delivery of a low carbon and climate resilient economy and/or (iii) applied to temporarily reduce indebtedness of a rev olving nature, where the original loan is not inconsistent with the delivery of a low carbon and climate resilient economy, before eventually being redrawn for investments or disbursements to E ligible G reen Assets . Sustainalytics notes that BTSG confirmed the exclusion of financing any emission intensive activities from temporary use of proceeds In addition, BTSG intends to disburse funds to Eligible Green Assets within a maximum of 24 months from the bond issuance date, and will adhere to the exclusionary criteria. This process is in line with market practice. • Reporting: - BTSG has committed to report allocation of proceeds on the C ompany’s website on an annual basis until full allocation . BTSG’s allocation reporting will include the balance amount of alloca ted and unallocated net proceeds as well as a summary of projects and the portion of proceeds use for financing vs refinancing. 6 Climate Bond s Standard version 3 . 0 : https://www.climatebonds.net/2019/12/climate - bonds - launches - version - 3 - international - climate - bonds - standard - universal,Second - Party Opinion BTSG Green Bond Framework 5 - In addition , BTSG committed, where possible, to report on impact includ ing relevant impact metrics such as number of passengers using the financed electric transportation per year and the reduction of CO 2 emission s per year . Alignment with ASEAN Green Bond Standards 2018 The ASEAN Green Bond Standards provide guidance to issuers and communicate more specifically what an issuer should do to issue a credible green bond within Southeast Asia. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the BTSG Green Bond Framework aligns with the ASEAN Green Bond Standards 2018. See Appendix 1: Alignment to the ASEAN Green Bond Standards. Alignment wi th Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that BTSG ’s g reen b ond aligns to the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 201 8 . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 2 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Fo rm. Section 2: Sustainability Strategy and Performance of the Issuer Contribution of framework to issuer’s sustainability strategy and performance BTSG has implemented a sustainable corporate strategy, The City Solutions Concept , as a guideline to the C ompany’s operations and business model. The strategy includes a commitment to execute energy efficiency management as well as the conservation and reduction of natural resources 7 as well as the following initiatives and targets: • BTSG has conducted a four - step assessment to identify material sustainability topics regarding the C ompany’s operations. Under the environmental aspects, the C ompany has identified several key subjects such as energy efficiency and the environmental footpr int for further improvement, including developing polices, objectives and goals. 8 • BTSG developed an environmental policy in which it commits to a sustainable and environmentally friendly operating railway , 9 i.e. electrified railways as well as initiatives such as a washing plant that reduces water, soap and disinfectants used, and manag ing significant environmental impacts in a proactive manner through implementing energy consumption measures, as well as promoting environmental impact awareness amongst its employees . 10 • Bangkok Mass Transit System PCL (BTSC) established an Energy Management System Committee in 2014/15 to focus on energy related issues, which includes oversight by the Chief Executive Officer serving as head of the committee. Moreover, a third - party audit and certification of the energy related data is conducted o n an annual basis . 11 • BTSG’s Supplier Code of Business Conduct defines environmental, social and governance commitments required from suppliers to ensure sustainable business throughout t he C ompany’s supply chain. Moreover, BTSG conducts suppliers’ risk assessment on an annual basis to identify potential environmental risks resulting from critical suppliers , 12 indicating that the C ompany’s sustainability efforts go beyond its own operations. • BTGS has defined energy - related thresholds and targets , such as not exceeding total electricity consumption of 2.80 kWh /car - km, traction power of < 50 kWh/1,000 passengers - km/month , and total el ectricity consumption of < 75,000 kWh /Day at train stations by 2019/20. 13 , 14 Even though BTSG’s has seen an increase in passengers and serviced route expansion, the Company has confirmed that it met all three target s in 2019/2020. 7 Sustainability at BTSG: http://www.btsgroup.co.th/en/sustainability/sustainability - guidelines 8 BTSG Materiality Assessment: http://www.btsgroup.co.th/en/sustainability/sustainable - performances/materiality - assessment 9 BTSG identifies environmentally friendly operating railways in terms of CO 2 emissions generated and energy consumption 10 BTS G Company Policies: https://bts.podrealm.com/website/eng/info/info - company_policies.html 11 BTSG Green Bond Framework 12 BTSG Sustainability Report 201 9 /20 20 pg. 34 : http://www.btsgroup.co.th/storage/download/sustainability/sr/bts - sd201920 - en.pdf 13 The track electrification refers to the type of source supply system that is used while powering the electric locomotive syst ems. It can be Alternating Current ( AC ), or Direct Current ( DC ) or a C omposite S upply. 14 BTSG Sustainability Report 201 9 /20 20 pg. 38 : http://www.btsgroup.co.th/storage/download/sustainability/sr/bts - sd201920 - en.pdf,Second - Party Opinion BTSG Green Bond Framework 6 • In addition, BTSG provides disclosure on its progress of environmental efforts . BTSG reduced its S cope 1 GHG emissions, direct emissions from owned or controlled sources , 15 by 40 % , and decreased its rapid bus fuel consumption by 6 % in 201 9 / 20 compared to 201 8 /1 9 levels. 16 Based on BTSG’s sustainability policies, strategy and initiatives , Sustainalytics believes that BTSG is well positioned to issue green bonds and that the E ligible Green Assets will help the C ompany advance its sustainability strategy as well as the overall climate ambitions of the Government of Thailand. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While the eligib le categor y is recognized as impactful by the Green Bond Principles 2018, Sustainalytics also recognizes that development of clean transportation and infrastructure might entail environmental risks related to infrastructure constructions , including waste disposal , loss o f biodiversity and land use change as well as social risks such as worker s’ health and safety risks, and community opposition . Sustainalytics highlights the following measures of BTSG and relevant regulation that mitigate related risks: • According to Thailand’s Notification of Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment regarding the types and specifications of projects that require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report, land allocation and construction activities related to ro ad s , highway and train lines is subject to the EIA Report requirement. 17 • In line with its risk management policy, BTSG‘ s risk management working group conducts risk assessments which include the environmental impact of the C ompany’s operations. BTSG ’s Environmental Management System is aligned with ISO 14001 18 and OHSAS 18001 19 standards , providing additional assurance that BTSG’s environmental and occupational health and safety management systems are aligned with international standards . • BTSG has estab lished a safety policy to manage occupational health and safety through identifying hazards , minimiz ing risks and implementing risk reduction and control measures together with regular reviews of safety related processes. 20 Moreover, BTSG provides disclosure on the implementation of the policy including frequency of trainings and number of accident, such as zero employee accident in the workplace in 2017/18. • BTSG has identified engagement channels, and disclosure of information for each sta keholder , including communities to voice the ir interests and provide feedback during decision making processes. 21 BTSG confirmed to Sustainalytics that public consultation had been conducted for the projects financed by the green bonds . Based on the regulatory requirements in Thailand , BTSG initiatives on environmental protection and community engagement, Sustainalytics believes that BTSG is well positioned to mitigate the main environmental and social risks associated with the eligible u se of proceeds category . Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds The use of proceed categor y is recognized as impactful by G reen B ond P rinciples . Importance of the shift towards mass and low carbon transit in Bangkok Thailand’s transportation sector relies 85% on road transportation , 22 mainly using private cars and motorcycles, increasing urban air pollution, decreasing safety , and increasing GHG emissions . 23 In addition , 15 Green House Gas Protocol: https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards_supporting/FAQ.pdf 16 BTSG Sustainability Report 201 9 /20 20 pg. 39 : http://www.btsgroup.co.th/storage/download/sustainability/sr/bts - sd201920 - en.pdf 17 Notification of Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment: https://www.jetro.go.jp/ext_images/thailand/pdf/iee_chonburi.pdf 18 The OHSAS 18001 an international standard de signed to enable organizations to control risks and improve performance in the area of occupational health and safety. 19 ISO 14001 is an international standard that specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system (EMS) 20 BTSG Safety Policy http://www.btsgroup.co.th/en/sustainability/sustainable - performances/relevant - policies 21 BTSG Sustainability Report 2017/2018 pg. 89 : http://www.btsgroup.co.th/storage/download/sustainability/sr/bts - sd201718 - en.pdf 22 Transportation Infrastructure in Thailand: Go Green or Go Grey, ACTS: http://www.uncrd.or.jp/content/documents/5602Presentation%205%20 - %20Module%202%20 - %20Mr.%20Surachet%20Pravinvongvuth.pdf 23 Private Motorized Transport, Bangkok, Thailand, Natcha Tulyasuwan, 2013 https://unhabitat.org/wp - content/uploads/2013/06/GRHS.2013.Case_.Study_.B angkok.Thailand.pdf,Second - Party Opinion BTSG Green Bond Framework 7 the transport sector accounts for more than one - third of final energy consumption, 24 and accounts for 19.2% of total GHG emission in Thailand 25 and 38% of GHG emissions in Bangkok. 26 T he rapid development of the Thai economy and its extensive rice - producing capacity 27 ma d e the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) the country’s most significant urban hub, accounting for almost 80% of the total urban area 28 and 22% of the total population 29 in Thailand. P opulation increase, and land use change have led to a rapid motorization in BMR , reaching a high level of motorcycle and car ownership before a mass transit systems were establish ed . 30 To mitigate mobility challenges and foster a shift towards mass and low carbon transit , the G overnment of Thailand adopted several transportation targets in its 12 th National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017 - 2021) 31 such as raising the proportion of passengers using public transportation systems, fostering the construction of mass - transit city - rail projects in the BM R , and expanding the mass rapid transit lines in BM R . In addition, the Government of Thailand set its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution in 2015 , 32 aiming to reduce GHG emissions by 20% from the projected business - as - usual (BAU) level by 2030 or a reducti on of approximately 555 MtCO 2 e , compared to 2005 levels . Moreover, the Bangkok Action Plan on Global Warming Mitigation (2013 - 2023) 33 includes a set of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures including environmentally sustainable transport and gre en urban planning. Since BTSG intends to use its green bond proceeds to invest in clean transportation assets , including electrified mass transit, and supporting infrastructure, Sustainalytics considers that BTSG’s investments will contribute to Thailand’s mobility and GHG emissions targets and foster a shift towards electrified mass transit in Bangkok. Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving susta inable development by the year 2030. This green bond advances the following SDG goal and target s : Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target s Clean transportation and supporting infrastructure 11 . Sustainable Cities and Commu nities 11.2 By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilitie s and older persons. 11.6 By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management Conclusion BTSG developed the BTSG Green Bond Framework un der which it intends to issue green bonds to finance c lean transportation projects including electric mass transit and i nfrastructure supporting clean transportation operations which will reduce Bangkok’s environmental footprint through assisting the shift to wards public and low carbon mobility and positively contribute to Thailand’s GHG reduction and clean 24 Thailand: Clean Energy for Green Low - Carbon Growth: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/576401468120848097/p df/662200WP0p12440e0Clean0Energy0all07.pdf 25 OTP and GIZ Strengthen the Movement on Low Carbon Mobility: https://www.transporta ndclimatechange.org/2019/01/31/otp - and - giz - strengthen - the - movements - on - low - carbon - mobility/ 26 Private Motorized Transport, Bangkok, Thailand, Natcha Tulyasuwan, 2013 https://unhabitat.org/wp - content/uploads/2013/06/GRHS.2013.Case_.Study_.Bangkok.Thailand.pdf 27 Private Motorized Transport, Bangkok, Thailand, Natcha Tulyasuwan, 2013 https://unhabitat.org/wp - content/uploads/2013/06/GRHS.2013.Case_.Study_.Bangkok.Thailand.pdf 28 Urbanization in Thailand is Dominated by the Bangkok Urban Area: http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/01/26/urbanization - in - thailand - is - dominated - by - the - bangkok - urban - area 29 Capital Facts for Bangkok, Thailand: https://www.worldscapitalcities.com/capital - facts - for - bangkok - thailand/ 30 Transport, urban structure and ‘lock - in’ in the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/docs/default - source/faculty - publications/paul - a - barter/barter - lockin - in - kl - idpr - pa per.pdf?sfvrsn=9230940b_2 31 The 12 th National Economic and Social Development Plan of Thailand: https://www.nesdb.go.th/nesdb_en/ewt_w3c/ewt_dl_link.php?nid=4345 32 Intended N ationally Determined Contribution and Relevant Information: https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Thailand/1/Th ailand_INDC.pdf 33 Bangkok Master Plan on Climate Change 2013 - 2023 http://www.mayorsforpeace.org/english/whatsnew/activity/data/2018/ Bangkok_Master_Plan_on_Climate_Change.pdf,Second - Party Opinion BTSG Green Bond Framework 8 transportation goals .

Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures , such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an as sessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds fro m Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a re cognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an establi shed scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion BTSG Green Bond Framework 16 Disclaimer Copyright ©2020 Sustainalytics.
