C O M / E S G 3 o f 2 2 SCOPE OF WORK Berlin Hyp AG (“Berlin Hyp” or “the issuer”) commissioned ISS ESG to assist with its Green Bonds by assessing th ree core elements to determine the sustainability quality of the instrument : 1. Green Bonds link to Berlin Hyp ’s sustainability strategy – drawing on Berlin Hyp ’s overall sustainability profile and issuance - specific Use of Proceeds categories. 2. Berlin Hyp ’s Green Bond Framework ( A pril 2020 version) – benchmarked against the International Capital Market Association' s ( ICMA ) Green Bond Principles (GBPs ). 3. The asset pool – whether the projects contribute positively to the UN SDGs and perform against ISS ESG ’s issue - specific key performance indicators (KPIs) (See Annex 1 ). ISS ESG ASSESSMENT SUMMARY 1 ISS ESG ’s evaluation is based on the Berlin Hyp’s Green Bond Fram ework ( April 202 0 version ), on the analysed asset pool as of 31.12.2020, and on the ISS ESG Corporate Rating applicable at the SPO delivery date (updated on the 14.12.2020). ISS ESG underwent a cont roversy screen ing of the asset pool on the 04.03.2021. SPO SECT ION SUMMARY EVALUATION 1 Part 1: Green Bonds link to issuer’s sustainability strategy According to the ISS ESG Corporate Rating published on 14.12 .2020, the issuer shows a good sustainability performance against the industry peer group on key ESG issues fa ced by the Mortgage & Public Sector Finance sector . The issuer is rated 3 rd out of 129 companies within its sector . T he Use of Proceeds category financed through this bond is consistent with the issuer’s sustainability strategy and ma terial ESG topics for the issuer’s industry. The rationale for issuing green bonds is clearly described by the issuer. Consistent with issuer’s sustainability strategy Part 2 : Alignment with GBPs The issuer has defined a formal concept for its Green Bonds regarding use of pro ceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the Green Bond Principles . Positive Part 3 : Sustaina bility quality of the Asset pool The overall sustainability quality of the a sset pool in terms of sustainability benefits, risk avoidance and minimisation is good based upon the ISS ESG assessment. The Green Bonds will (re - )finance one eligible asset categ or y: commercial real estate. Those use of proceed s categories have a significan t contribution to SDG 11 “Sustainable cities and communities” and a limited contribution to SDGs 7 “Affordable and c lean energy’ and 13 ‘Climate action’. The environmental and social risks associated with those use of proceeds categories have been well man aged.

ASSESSMENT OF BERLIN HYP ’S ESG PERFORMANCE The ISS ESG Corporate Rating provides material and forward - looking environmental, social and governance (ESG) data and per formance assessments. C O M P A N Y B E R L I N H Y P S E C T O R M O R T G A G E & P U B L I C S E C T O R F I N A N C E D E C I L E R A N K 1 T R A N S P A R E N C Y L E V E L V E R Y H I G H This means that the bank currently shows a good sustainability performance against peers on key ESG issues fac ed by the Mortgage & Public Sector Finance sector and obtains a Decile Rank relative to industry group of 1 , given that a decile rank of 1 indicates highest relative ESG performance out of 10. ESG performance As of 30 .03.2021 , Berlin Hyp ranks 3 rd out of 129 companies rated by ISS ESG in the Mortgage & Public Sector Finance sector. Key c hallenges faced by companies in term s of sustainability management in this sector are displayed in the chart on the right, as well as the issuer’s performan ce against those key challenges in comparison to the average industry peers’ performance. Sustainability Opportunities With regard to the bank 's main sphere of activities, large - volume real estate financing, there is potential for the provision of fundin g to social housing. Albeit some loans of that kind were granted to charitable housing cooperatives, volumes are not publicly disclosed and thus such finance is estimated to remain still modest. In the environmental domain, the bank endeavors to promote en vironmentally friendly commercial real estate by issuing several green bonds in two assets classes ( Pfandbrief ; senior unsecured). Unde rlying assets qualify for the green finance portfolio through certain green building standards, such as BREEAM, LEED or DG NB and through energy - efficiency performance certificates. At the end of 2019, close to 22 percent of the bank 's total loan portfolio accounted for such sustainable buildings.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d s As s e t p ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 5 o f 2 2 Sustainability Risks The bank 's green finance portfolio claims are mainly distributed throughout Ger many, France and the Netherlands, countries with fairly good environmental and social minimum standards. Hence, risks from Berlin Hyp's financing activities appear moderately low. Moreover, for managing its socia l and environmental risks stemming from loan origination, Berlin Hyp applies comprehensive guidelines concerning its real estate financing segment. Guidelines include client - related stipulations in various environmental and social areas, from resource effi ciency, pollution, biodiversity aspects and climate change impacts to human and labor rights, community matters such as noise and traffic, and regarding vulnerable population groups. Although Berlin Hyp is pioneering the sector with such comparatively soph isticated guidelines, there is room for impr ovement for the institute to establish a more elaborated system for compliance in that area . With regard to its own (liquidity) investment portfolio, the bank uses a set of exclusion criteria concerning contro versial business sectors and practices. These are followed through with an appropriate management approach. Since the bank does not engage in retail finance and deals with professional real estate developers only, customer - related risks appear manageable. Some steps are taken on resp onsible sales practices as well as towards the treatment of clients with debt repayment problems. A policy covering workplace security is in place and there is no evidence on large - scale redundancies over the last years. Various working time models ensure adequate work - life balance of its employees and the bank addressed health and safety issues with a bank - wide management system, which covers also aspects of psychological well - being. With regard to its govern ance processes, Berlin Hyp applies policies cove ring various important compliance issues, like corruption, insider trading and money laundering, antitrust, gifts and favors. Necessary procedures to ensure application of the rules are present through employ ee trainings, compliance risk assessments and wh istleblowing procedures. Governance opinion The bank 's governance structure allows for an appropriate separation of managerial and supervisory functions with the entirety of members of the board qualifying as independent, including the board's chairman Mr Helmut Schleweis (as at October 21, 2020). Furthermore, the board has established committees concerning audit, nomination and remuneration, all composed of independent members. Compensation for the executi ve management team is reported for each individual , split up according to fixed and variable amounts as well as long - term incentives. Regarding the bank ’s governance of sustainability, a committee dedicated to sustainability appears to be missing. In addit ion, ESG criteria apparently are not incorporated into the bank's executive remuneration scheme. Berlin Hyp's code of conduct covers all relevant aspects of business ethics, such as corruption, insider trading, conflicts of interest, antitrust, gifts and f avors, of which some are reflected on in more deta il. Application of the rules is ensured by employee trainings, compliance risk assessments and adequate whistleblowing procedures. Sustainability impact of products and services portfolio Using a proprietary methodology, ISS ESG assessed the contribution of Berlin Hyp ’s current products and services portfolio to the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations (UN SDGs).,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d s As s e t p ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

B. CONSISTENCY OF GREEN BONDS WITH BERLIN HYP ’S SUSTAINABILITY STRAT EGY Key sustainability objectives and priorities defined by the issuer 2 Sustainability is an important aspect of Berlin Hyp’s corporate strategy. In 2013, Berlin Hyp decided to systemise the bank’s existing approaches and processes in a sustainability mana gement system. Berlin Hyp recognizes its responsibility towards climate change and has committed to the Paris Agreement and the Climate Paths of the Federal Republic of Germany. To illustrate this commitment, the bank has set itself in 2020 the target to c ontinuously reduce its CO 2 emissions until climate neutrality in 2050. To achieve that, Berlin Hyp has identified in 2020 three key meas ures to support the transition path of its business: 1. A third of its loans portfolio should include green buildings by 2 025 2. The bank will create portfolio transparency by systematically recording energy values, calculating CO2 emissions and determining the climate risks of existing properties 3. The bank will introduce new sustainability products with a first step being Transf ormationskredit (transformation loan) 2 Sustainab ility Objectives defined by Berlin Hyp as 30 June 2020,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d s As s e t p ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 7 o f 2 2 In 2019, one year earlier than planned, the b ank reached a target set in 2017 , aiming at having gr een lending attaining at least 20% of total lending by the end of 2020 . Rationale for issu ance According to the issuer’s Green Bond Framework, financing green buildings represents the part of Berlin Hyp's sustainability measures that is closest to its core business: commercial real estate lending. In order to further strengthen its green building lending, the bank introduce d pricing incentives for eligible business earlier in 2016 . As buildings account for 30 to 40 per cent of total energy demand and about 30 per cent of total energy related CO 2 emissions worldwide, Berlin Hyp is willing to actively contribute to the avoidan ce of CO 2 emissions by financing sustainable and low energy buildings. By issuing Green Bonds it offers investors the opportunity to sup port these efforts to aid in the transition to a low carbon economy. Berlin Hyp is an experienced Pfandbrief issuer and aims at offering investors maximum transparency. Due to the requirements of the German Pfandbrief Act the bank discloses detailed inform ation on its cover pool. Contribution of Use of Proceeds categories to sustainability objectives and priorities ISS ESG mapped the Use of Proceeds categories financed under this Green Bonds with the sustainability objectives defined by the issuer, and with the key ESG industry challenges as defined in the ISS ESG Corporate Rating methodology for the Mortgage & Public Secto r Finance sector . Key ESG industry challenges are key issues that are highly relevant for a respective industry to tackle when it comes to sustainability, e.g. climate change and energy efficiency in the buildings sector. From this mapping, ISS ESG derived a level of contribution to the strategy of each Use of Proceeds categ ories. USE OF PROCEEDS CATEGORY SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES FOR THE ISSUER KEY ESG INDUSTRY CHALLENGES CONTRIBUTION Commercial Green Buildings A third of Berlin Hyp’s loans portf olio should include green buildings by 2025 Sustainability impacts of lending and other financial services/products Contribution to a material objective Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the Use of Proceeds category financed through this bond is consistent wit h the issuer’s sustainability strategy and material ESG topics for the issuer’s industry. The rationale for issuing green bonds is clearly described by the issuer.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d s As s e t p ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 8 o f 2 2 PART I I : ALIGNMENT WITH GREEN BOND PRINCIPLES 1. Use of Proceeds The proceeds of the Green Bonds (Green Pfandbriefe as well as Green Seniors) to be issued by Berlin Hyp will be exclusively used to finance and refinance the acquisition, construction or refurbishment of Green Buildings. These Green Buildings serve as coll ateral for loans granted b y or to be granted by Berlin Hyp. If they are used for Green Pfandbriefe the loans have to be eligible for and included in or to be included in the bank's mortgage cover pool. Details regarding the assets included in the Green Bo nd are listed in the follo wing table (based on loans outstanding): GREEN ASSET CATEGORY NUMBER OF OBJECTS VOLUME OF GREEN BOND ASSET POOL (EUR MILL ION) Green Buildings: Commercial real estate 238 buildings 5,983.85 TOTAL 5,983.85 (100%) Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Use of Pr oceeds description provided by Berlin Hyp’s Framework as aligned with the Green Bond Principles. Sustainability objectives are clearly stated and align with the strategy of Berlin Hyp. 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection Berlin Hyp has establishe d a Green Building Commission (GBC). This consists of one representative from each of the following divisions of the bank: Corporate Strategy, Origination, Credit, Appraisal and Treasury. In its regular mee tings the GBC discusses whether eligibility criter ia are still in line with market best practices of Green Building definition. If not, the GBC will discuss possible changes and decide on how to adapt the eligibility criteria. Any change shall only lead to stricter criteria, which means a lower level of e nergy demand and/or consumption. At the beginning of the acquisition process, Berlin Hyp’s borrowers are being asked to provide relevant documents concerning the eligibility for the bank’s green finance por tfolio, i.e. primarily EPCs and sustainability cer tificates. Energy demand calculations are used in case of property developments. The experts in the bank’s appraisal division assess a property’s qualification as a green building. In case of a positive dec ision by the appraisers, sales staff is allowed to deduct up to 10 basis points when pre - calculating the loan. Credit staff documents an asset’s green building eligibility in the bank’s loan monitoring system. After documentation, Treasury votes on the ass et’s compliance with the green finance portfolio e ligibility criteria and whether it should be included in Berlin Hyp’s green finance portfolio. This ensures a four - eye - principle with respect to the identification process. Only loans that have been approve d by both divisions, Appraisal and Treasury, are c lassified by credit staff as green bond eligible in the bank’s loan monitoring system. In any case, data on the properties’ energy efficiency and,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d s As s e t p ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 9 o f 2 2 sustainability are entered into the loan monitoring system e ven if a property doesn’t fulfill eligibility crit eria. As this process is applied to all new business, it is one of Berlin Hyp’s longer term targets to provide evidence about its entire mortgage loan portfolio’s energy efficiency. If the document proving a green buildings’ eligibility expires, Berlin Hyp will ask its borrower for new evidence in order to re - assess the property’s eligibility. Borrowers are allowed a one - year grace period to provide new evidence. If a borrower does not provide a new EPC and/ or sustainability certificate or the new EPC and/o r sustainability certificate does not meet Berlin Hyp’s eligibility criteria, the asset is removed from the bank’s portfolio of eligible assets. Eligibility criteria PROPERTY TYPE ENERGY DEMAND HEATING KWH /(M²*A) ENERGY DEMAND ELECTRICITY KWH/(M²*A) IN TO TAL KWH/(M²*A) Residential 60 - 60 Office 3 80 60 140 Retail 60 75 135 Hotels 95 60 155 Logistics buildings (use: storage) 30 35 65 Light industrial (use: production) 105 65 170 In addition/alternatively, eligibility criteria include the following ex ternal sustainability certifications: • LEED – Gold or above • BREEAM – Very Good or above • DGNB – Gold or above • HQE – High Level or above Eligible assets shall also meet other environmental and/or social criteria. These assets are not to be used for the produc tion of arms, pesticides, tobacco, pornography, nuclear power, coal, oil and fossil fuels. Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Process for Project Evaluation and Selection descr iption provided by Berlin Hyp’s Green Bond Framework as aligned with the Green Bond Principles. The r esponsibilities are clearly defined, and the eligibility criteria are transparently displayed and reviewed frequently to ensure their alignment with mar ket best practices. 3 Based on third - party energy consultant data, Berlin Hyp decided in 2020 to further strengthen the category threshold for office buildings in order to refl ect Berlin Hyp’s long term strategy and its specific asset portfolio.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d s As s e t p ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 0 o f 2 2 3. Management of Proceeds Eligible assets already exist on Berlin Hyp 's balance sheet (and in the case of a Green Pfandbrief in its mortgage cover pool) at issuance of a new Green Bond. They are not booked in a separate portfolio but flagg ed in the bank's legal loan monitoring system. Thus, they form a sub - portfolio of Berl in Hyp’s overall loan book. The bank shall report on the development of this sub - portfolio on an annual basis. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that Management of Proceeds proposed by Berlin Hyp’s Green Bond Framework aligns with the Green Bond Principles. The proc eeds are appropriately tracked internally. 4. Reporting Berlin Hyp provides information about its green bonds on its websi te www.berlinhyp.de/de/investoren/green - bonds . The English version of the website may be found under www.berlinhyp.de/en/inve stors/green - bonds . Relevant documents and information concerning the bank's green bond activities are published on its website. This al so contains the bank's reports on its green bonds. As long as Berlin Hyp has green bonds outstanding, the bank will repor t on an annual basis. Each report will contain details about: i. The development of eligible assets on Berlin Hyp's balance sheet and in i ts mortgage cover pool on a stratified basis ii. New business in eligible assets since the last report and assignment of elig ible assets to issued bonds on a loan - by - loan basis iii. Carbon emissions avoidance (impact reporting) evaluated in comparison to one or mor e appropriate baselines 4 . Berlin Hyp publishes annual green bond reportings since 2016. Reports will remain available for investors for future reference on the bank’s website. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the reporting proposed Berlin Hyp Green Bond Framewo rk aligns with the Green Bond Principles. The allocation and impact reporting occur annually on the integrality of its mo rtgage cover pool , on a stratified basis. The impact reporting aligns with best market practices thanks to the comparison of the repor ted data with appropriate baselines and to the transparency of its calculation methodology. External review Second Party Opinion Berlin Hyp has appointed ISS ESG to assess the sustainability of its Green Bond Program. ISS ESG applies its own framework to carry out this assessment. The results are documented in ISS ESG's Second Party Opinion which is available on the bank's website. The Second Party Opinion refers to the whole Green Bond Program and includes every security that is issued under it. 4 The methodology for calculating carbon emissions avoidance is document in every edition of Berlin Hyp’s Annual Green Bond Reporting and published on its website.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d s As s e t p ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 1 o f 2 2 Annual Re - verification ISS ESG or any other party appointed by Berlin Hyp later as a successor for ISS ESG in the futu re will issue a report verifying the compliance of all issued bonds with the criteria documented in this program on an annual basis. These reports will reflect the results of the assessment of the sustainability performance of the program and the issued Gr een Pfandbriefe and Green Senior bonds. The reports will be published on the bank's website.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d s As s e t p ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ASSET POOL Green commercial real estate As a Use of Proceeds category, green commercial real estate has a significant contribution to the SDG 11 “Sustainable cities and communities”, when meeting stringen t enough sustainability criteria , and a limited contribution to SDGs 7 “Affordable and clean ” and 13 “Climate action” when achieving high energy efficiency . The table below presents the findings of an ISS ESG assessment of the assets (re - ) financed against KPIs related to environmental and social risks applicable for commercial real estate. A S S E S S M E N T A G A I N S T I S S E S G K P I Prerequisite: Energy efficiency ✓ All the assets underwent an appropriate and detailed selection process that ensures good standards reg arding energy efficiency. All the assets are in line with the German Energy Savings Regulation (EnEV) and/or have received sustainability certificates such as LEED (Gold or above), BREEAM (Very Good or above), DGNB (Gold or above), HQE (High Level or above ). 1. Environmental standards for site selection ✓ All assets are located in metro politan areas, avoiding the risk of greenfield construction. ✓ 233 assets out of 238 assets, accounting for 97% of the asset pool, are located within a maximum of 1 km fro m one or more modalities of public transport. 2. Construction standards ✓ All the assets are located in countries where high labour and health and safety standards are in place for construction and maintenance work (e.g. ILO core conventions).  For l ess than 50% of the assets in the asset pool, sustainable procurement measures regarding building materials are in place (e.g. recycled materials, third - party certification of wood - base d materials). No information is available for the remaining assets. 3. Water use minimisation in buildings ✓ For more than 50% of the assets in the asset pool, adequate measures to reduce water use (e.g. greywater recycling, efficient applications) are in place.

C O M / E S G 1 5 o f 2 2 C. A NNUAL CO 2 A VOIDANCE OF THE B UILDINGS IN ASSET POOL Berlin Hyp established two baselines in order to compare the buildings to existing standards: The firs t baseline is the average energy performance of European buildings, the second one the German Energy Sa vings Ordinance (EnEV). Further, Berlin Hyp chose to provide investors with the carbon avoidance that is linked to Berlin Hyp’s initial financing share o f the respective buildings as well as with the complete carbon avoidance, i.e. the avoidance caused by the complete buildings. More details on the methodology regarding CO2 avoidance can be found in the initial Second Party Opinion from 2016. The calculat ions were based on an assessment of the carbon intensity of different energy sources for heating and di fferentiation of carbon intensity of each country’s electricity mix and district heating supply as well as further differentiation of the district heatin g supply in Germany by region. The calculations on energy and CO2 data were carried out by Berlin Hyp, ISS ESG carried out a basic plausibility check. More information on the calculations is provided by Berlin Hyp at https://www.berlinhyp.de/en/investors/green - bonds . The following table shows the results of estimations and calculations on the CO2 performance of the buildings withi n the asset pool for the Green Bond Programme (excluding buildings that were in the cover pool at issuance of the Green Pfandbrief in 2015) .

C O M / E S G 1 7 o f 2 2 ANNEX 1 : Methodology ISS ESG Green KPIs The ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs serve as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality – i.e. the social and environmental added va lue – of the use of proceeds of Berlin Hyp ’s Green Bonds . It comprises firstly the definition of the use of procee ds category offering added social and/or environmental value, and secondly the specific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the assets can be clearly identified and described. The sustainability criteria are complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measurement of the sustainability performance of the a ssets and which can also be used for reporting. If a majority of assets fulfill the requirement of an indicator , this indicator is then assessed positively. Those indicators may be tailor - made to capture the context - specific environmental and social risks. To review the KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Federico Pezzolato (details below) who will send them dir ectly to you. Environmental and social risks assessment methodology ISS ESG evaluates whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eli gible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bond KPIs. All percentages refer to the amount of asse ts within one category (e.g. wind power). Additionally, the assessment “no or limited information is available” either indicates that no informat ion was made available to ISS ESG or that the information provided did not fulfil the requirements of the ISS E SG Green Bond KPIs. The evaluation was carried out using information and documents provided to ISS ESG on a confidential basis by Berlin Hyp (e.g . Due Diligence Reports). Further, national legislation and standards, depending on the asset location, were dr awn on to complement the information provided by the issuer. Assessment of the contribution and association to the SDG The 17 Sustainable Develop ment Goals (SDGs) were endorsed in September 2015 by the United Nations and provide a benchmark for key opportu nities and challenges toward a more sustainable future. Using a proprietary method, ISS ESG identifies the extent to which Berlin Hyp ’s Green Bon ds contributes to related SDGs.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f th e Is s u er an d Gr e en Bon d s As s e t p ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 8 o f 2 2 ANNEX 2 : ISS ESG Corporate Rating Methodology The following pages contain met hodology description of the ISS ESG Corporate Rating .,Berlin Hyp AG Methodology - Overview The ESG Corporate Rating methodology was originally developed by Institutional Shareholder Services Germany (formerly oekom research) and has been consistently updated for more than 25 years. ESG Corporate Rating - The ESG Corporate Rating universe, which is currently expanding from more than 8,000 corporate issuers to a targeted 10,000 issuers in 2020, covers important national and international indices as well as additional companies from sectors with direct links to sustainability and the most important bond issuers that are not publicly listed companies. The assessment of a company's social & governance and environmental performance is based on approximately 100 environmental, social and governance indicators per sector, selected from a pool of 800+ proprietary indicators. All indicators are evaluated independently based on clearly defined performance expectations and the results are aggregated, taking into account each indicator’s and each topic’s materiality-oriented weight, to yield an overall score (rating). If no relevant or up-to-date company information with regard to a certain indicator is available, and no assumptions can be made based on predefined standards and expertise, e.g. known and already classified country standards, the indicator is assessed with a D-. In order to obtain a comprehensive and balanced picture of each company, our analysts assess relevant information reported or directly provided by the company as well as information from reputable independent sources. In addition, our analysts actively seek a dialogue with the assessed companies during the rating process and companies are regularly given the opportunity to comment on the results and provide additional information. Analyst Opinion - Qualitative summary and explanation of the central rating results in three dimensions: (1) Opportunities - assessment of the quality and the current and future share of sales of a company’s products and services, which positively or negatively contribute to the management of principal sustainability challenges. (2) Risks - summary assessment of how proactively and successfully the company addresses specific sustainability challenges found in its business activity and value chain, thus reducing its individual risks, in particular regarding its sector’s key issues. (3) Governance - overview of the company’s governance structures and measures as well as of the quality and efficacy of policies regarding its ethical business conduct. Norm-Based Research - Severity Indicator - The assessment of companies' sustainability performance in the ESG Corporate Rating is informed by a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of companies' ability to prevent and mitigate ESG controversies. ISS ESG conducts research and analysis on corporate involvement in verified or alleged failures to respect recognized standards for responsible business conduct through Norm-Based Research . Norm-Based Research is based on authoritative standards for responsible business conduct such as the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights and the Sustainable Development Goals. As a stress-test of corporate disclosure, Norm-Based Research assesses the following: - Companies' ability to address grievances and remediate negative impacts - Degree of verification of allegations and claims - Severity of impact on people and the environment, and systematic or systemic nature of malpractices Severity of impact is categorized as Potential, Moderate, Severe, Very severe. This informs the ESG Corporate Rating. Decile Rank - The Decile Rank indicates in which decile (tenth part of total) the individual Corporate Rating ranks within its industry from 1 (best – company’s rating is in the first decile within its industry) to 10 (lowest – company’s rating is in the tenth decile within its industry). The Decile Rank is determined based on the underlying numerical score of the rating. If the total number of companies within an industry cannot be evenly divided by ten, the surplus company ratings are distributed from the top (1 decile) to the bottom. If there are Corporate Ratings with identical absolute scores that span a division in decile ranks, all ratings with an equal decile score are classified in the higher decile, resulting in a smaller number of Corporate Ratings in the decile below. Distribution of Ratings - Overview of the distribution of the ratings of all companies from the respective industry that are included in the ESG Corporate Rating universe (company portrayed in this report: dark blue). ESG Corporate Rating / Last Modification: 2020-12-14 Page 7 © ISS ESG,Berlin Hyp AG Methodology - Overview Industry Leaders - List (in alphabetical order) of the top three companies in an industry from the ESG Corporate Rating universe at the time of generation of this report. Key Issue Performance - Overview of the company's performance with regard to the key social and environmental issues in the industry, compared to the industry average. Performance Score - The ESG Performance Score allows for cross-industry comparisons using a standardized best-in-class threshold that is valid across all industries. It is the numerical representation of the alphabetic ratings (D- to A+) on a scale of 0 to 100 with 50 representing the prime threshold. All companies with values greater than 50 are Prime, while companies with values less than 50 are Not Prime. As a result, intervals are of varying size depending on the original industry-specific prime thresholds. Rating History - Development of the company's rating over time and comparison to the average rating in the industry. Rating Scale - Companies are rated on a twelve-point scale from A+ to D-: A+: the company shows excellent performance. D-: the company shows poor performance (or fails to demonstrate any commitment to appropriately address the topic). Overview of the range of scores achieved in the industry (light blue) and indication of the grade of the company evaluated in this report (dark blue). Sources of Information - A selection of sources used for this report is illustrated in the annex. Status & Prime Threshold - Companies are categorized as Prime if they achieve/exceed the sustainability performance requirements (Prime threshold) defined by ISS ESG for a specific industry (absolute best-in-class approach) in the ESG Corporate Rating. Prime companies are sustainability leaders in their industry and are better positioned to cope with material ESG challenges and risks, as well as to seize opportunities, than their Not Prime peers. The financial materiality of the Prime Status has been confirmed by performance studies, showing a continuous outperformance of the Prime portfolio when compared to conventional indices over more than 14 years. Transparency Level - The Transparency Level indicates the company’s materiality-adjusted disclosure level regarding the environmental and social performance indicators defined in the ESG Corporate Rating. It takes into consideration whether the company has disclosed relevant information regarding a specific indicator, either in its public ESG disclosures or as part of the rating feedback process, as well as the indicator’s materiality reflected in its absolute weight in the rating. The calculated percentage is classified in five transparency levels following the scale below. 0% - < 20%: very low 20% - < 40%: low 40% - < 60%: medium 60% - < 80%: high 80% - 100%: very high For example, if a company discloses information for indicators with a cumulated absolute weight in the rating of 23 percent, then its Transparency Level is “low”. A company’s failure to disclose, or lack of transparency, will impact a company’s ESG performance rating negatively. Industry Classification - The social and environmental impacts of industries differ. Therefore, based on its relevance, each industry analyzed is classified in a Sustainability Matrix. Depending on this classification, the two dimensions of the ESG Corporate Rating, the Social Rating and the Environmental Rating, are weighted and the sector-specific minimum requirements for the ISS ESG Prime Status (Prime threshold) are defined (absolute best-in-class approach).
