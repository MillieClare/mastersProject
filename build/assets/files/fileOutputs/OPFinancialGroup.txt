It currently operates three segments: Banking Private and SME custom ers , Banking Corporate and Institutional customers and Insurance Private and Corporate customers. The company was founded in 1902 and is headquartered in Helsinki, Finland. OP Financial has developed the OP Financial Group Green Bond Framework (the “ frame work ”) under which it is plann ing to issue multiple green bonds and use the proceeds to finance and refinance, in whole or in part, existing and future projects and businesses that support one of OP’s core values – responsibility. The framework defines eli gibility criteria in six areas: 1. Renewable Energy 2. Energy Efficiency 3. Green Building s 4. Pollution Prevention and Control (including Sus tainable Water Management) 5. Sustainable Land Use 6. Clean Transportation OP Financial engaged Sustainalytics to review the OP Financial Group Green Bond Framework and provide a second - party opinion on the alignment of the green bond with the Green Bond Principles 2018 (the “GBP”), as administered by the International Capital Market Association (the “ICMA”) , 1 with the framework’s environmental credentials. This framework has been published in a separate document on OP Financial’ s debt IR website . 2 As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of OP Financial ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of OP Financial ’s green bond. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This d ocument contains Sustainalytics’ opinion 3 of the OP Financial Group Green Bond Framework and should be read in conjunction with that framework. 1 ICMA’s Green Bond Principles 2018: https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ 2 www.op.fi/debtinvestors 3 This second - party opinion was revised November 12, 2018 to account for revisions made to the OP Financial Green Bond Framework. The revised Framework excludes general purpose lending to companies that are “leading players in terms of ESG criteria in their relev ant fields”. Sustainalytics considers that this strengthens the framework.,Second - Party Opinion OP Financial Group Green Bond 3 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the OP Financial Group Green Bond Framework Summ ary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the OP Financial Group Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles (GBP) 201 8 . Some of the key elements of the bonds are:  Use of Proceeds: o The use of proceeds categories , (i) Renewable Energy , (ii) Energy Efficiency , (iii) Green Buildings , (iv) Pollution Prevention and Control (including Sustainable Water Management) , (v) Sustainable Land Use and (vi) Clean Transportation are recognized as i mpactful by the GBP and OP Financial uses recognized third party standards , such as LEED and BREEAM for green buildings and FSC/ PEFC for sustainable forestry. A detailed analysis of the standards used is disclosed in Appendi x 1 and 2 . o OP Financial will f inance new or recently built commercial or public Green B uildings with an EPC label of B or higher in Finland . Commercial or public buildings includes new and existing buildings based on 2013 and 2018 laws and excludes single family housing. Based on EPC d ata provided by the issuer and the Finance Housing and Development Center of Finland, Sustainalytics has assessed that through this eligibility criteria OP Financial is financing buildings that fall in the top 9% of most energy efficient commercial or publ ic buildings in the Finnish building stock. This is above the 15% g uideline set by the Climate Bonds Initiative . o While OP Financial intends to refinance existing loans, OP Financial does not provide a lookback period for the refinanced projects and compa nies. However, OP Financial commits to disclose the origination timeframe and maturity profile of the loans per eligible criteria in its annual reporting.  Project Selection Process: o OP Financial has a dedicated green bond committee, chaired by a member of the company’s executive board and comprised of senior management from corporate sustainability, finance and group treasury, and the banking, corporate and institutional customers business segment , which approves each loan against the framework’s eligibili ty criteria. This is aligned with market practice. o OP Financial developed internal guidelines for the selection of eligible projects and businesses . For the financing of general purpose loans to pure players (see further information below) , OP Financial applies an additional three - step process that includes exclusionary criteria, ESG performance of a company and detailed criteria per eligible category that speak , among others , to the environmental and social risk management of the eligible project/business . Sustainalytics considers th e inclusion of ESG performance assessment in the selection process to be aligned with market best practice.  Management of Proceeds: o OP Financial has committed to establish ing a green bond register for each sep arate bond issuance to earmark the proceeds and track their allocation, a s aligned with market practice. o Any un allocated proceeds in the Green Bond Register will be held in accordance with OP’s conventional liquidity management policy.  Reporting: o Aligned with market standards, OP Financial has committed to report ing annually on the allocation of proceeds and intends to report impact indicators in a sep arate gre e n bond report . OP Financial intends to report on the allocation of proceeds to eligible sector s including a description of the types of business and projects financed , as well as the amount of unallocated proceeds. o OP Financial intends to report annually on the impact of the use of proceeds per sector financed, including impact metrics, such as rene wable energy generated ( kWh) , tonnes CO 2 avoided, energy saved ( kWh /year ) , number of certified buildings, amount of water recycled/reduced/purified, land area under sustainably certified forests , land area transformed,Second - Party Opinion OP Financial Group Green Bond 4 from heavily polluting land use to eco - friendly land use and n umber of public trams/ trains/ metros financed . If projects are not yet operational , OP Financial plans to report on estimated impact. This approach and indicators are aligned with market standards. Inclusion of non - project based l ending Sustainalytics recognizes that the GBP prefer project - based len ding and financing. The OP Financial Group Green Bond Framework includes project based lending and it also contemplates the inclusion of non - project based lending activit ies and expenditure for g eneral purpose loans to pure play companies (named “dedicated businesses”) deriving 90% of their turnover from the eligible categories. Given th e provi si o n s set out above, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the proceeds of the OP Financial Group g reen bonds – whether they are used for capital and/or operational expenditures associated with financing/refinancing project - based or non - project - based lending/expenditure activities - will contribute to supporting businesses and activities which en sure the provision of products and services that are necessary to achieving sustainable development in the long term. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 2018 Sustainalytics has determined that OP Financial ’s g reen b ond aligns with the four core componen ts o f the Green Bond Principles 2018 . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 3 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Performance of OP Financial Contribution of framework to OP Financial ’s sustainabi lity strategy and targets OP Financial integrates sustainability into its business strategy . The company revised its sustainability strategy in 2017 , set ting targets to have its own ope rations carbon positive by 2025 , and formulat ing binding climate princi ples for the entire OP Financial Group. The company offers sustainable services such as mobility services for car sharing and is committed to the construction of approximately 100 charging stations for electric cars in Finland. Since 2017, OP Financial pu blishes fund - specific environmental, social and governance (ESG) analyses, including companies’ carbon footprints and positive environmental impact , for its customers . Moreover, OP Financial exclude s high - carbon companies from active investments and has es tablished an ESG unit for sustainable investing to broaden ESG activity and utilize more ESG information in investment decision - makin g, demonstrating its efforts towards sustainable finance. 4 The group’s commitment to sustainable finance is further suppor ted by its signat ory status to the UN Global Compact Principles since 2011 . In addition, its fund and asset management companies signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI) in 2009 and signed the CDP Climate change and Water initiatives whe reby investors encourage companies to report their impact on climate and their water usage in a better way. 5 Given OP Financial’s sustainability strategy , targets and efforts , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the company is well positioned to issue a green bond. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that some of the eligible criteria included in the green bond framework have potential environmental and social risks, such as risks related to biodiversity, depletion of carbon pools , 4 OP Financial corporate website: Sustainable investment, accessed June 2018: https://uusi.op.fi/op - financial - group/reponsibility/responsible - business/sustainable - investment 5 OP F inancial corporate website: Commitments and principles, accessed June 2018: https://uusi.op.fi/op - financial - group/corporate - social - responsibility/commitments - and - principles,Second - Party Opinion OP Financial Group Green Bond 5 occupational health and safety and community relations related to large renewable energy projects, transportation infrastructure , forestry and buildings , Sustainalytics is of the opin ion that OP Financial is well positioned to manage related environmental and social risk s as follow s : i. OP Financial’s project and business selection process for the green b ond use of proceeds considers the ESG performance of businesses and excludes loans that finance the production and trade of w eapons and ammunition , gambling, casinos and related businesses and loans that directly finance nuclear or fossil - fuel energy generation . ii. The selection process for general purpose loans includes an additional ste p of selection, including a more detailed set of indicators for each eligible category , which OP Financial has disclosed to Sustainalytics. The indic at ors include environmental life - cycle impact assessments for power plants, asset al location in countries w ith high health and safety standards for employees and contractors and involvement of residents in the construction of new buildings. Sustainalytics considers the additional criteria to be strong , contributing to mitigat ing risks related to the use of proc eeds . iii. OP Financial is a signatory to the Equator Principles, 6 a globally recognized third - party risk management framework. iv. OP Financial limits investments in forestry activity to recognized third - party certified forests, i.e. Forest Stewardship Council’s® (FSC ) and Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). While PEFC has faced criticism from civil society organizations, FSC is considered to be the strongest forest certification system for sustainable forest management. See Appendix 2 for Sustainalytics’ assessment of the FSC and PEFC standards. v. OP Financial limits investments financed by green bond p roceeds in hydropower projects and businesses to plants below 20 MW for new projects , limiting risk related to community and biodiversity, as well as green ho use gas emissions related to large hydro plants . Furthermore, f inancing includes large hydro po wer plants but only existing on e s in Finland, Sweden and Norway which are more than 10 years old. Sustainalytics considers the risk related to existing large hyd ro power plants in the regions targeted as limited given the low GHG emissions in boreal reservoirs 7 older than 10 years. 8 Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All s ix use of proceeds categories are recognized as impactful by GBP. Sustainalytics has focu sed on the four below where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context. Impact of renewable energy, energy efficiency and clean transportation Finland in its National Climate Act (609/2015) set the target to reduce GHG emissions by at least 80% by 2050, compared to the 1990 levels. 9 In 2014, a pproximately 80% of all GHG emissions in Finland ca me from energy production and consumption, with transport accounting for 27% . 10 In 2016 , the energy industr y accounted for 32% of the countr y’ s GHG emis sions, 11 highligh ting the importance of the sector ’s contribut ion to the countr y’ s GHG reduction targets. Thus, Sustainalytics believes that the use of proceeds to foster energy efficiency and low carbon transportation can meaningfully contribute to Finland ’s GHG reduction targets. W hile Finland already exceeded its 2020 renewable energy target of 38% in 2016, 12 Sustainalytics believes that supporting the further growth of renewable energy production can contribute to Finland’s GHG reduction targets and the EU renewable energy target of 20% by 2020. 6 The Equator Principles: http://equator - principles.com/ 7 International Rivers, Re servoir Emissions: https://www.internationalrivers.org/campaigns/reservoir - emissions 8 The Issue of Greenhouse Gases From Hydroelectric Resevoirs: From Boreal Regions to Tropical Regions: http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sdissues/energy/op/hydro_tremblaypaper.pdf 9 Finland Ministry of the Environment, October 2017: http://www.ym.fi/en - US/The_environment/Climate_and_air/Mitigation_of_climate_change/National_climate_policy 10 Ministry of Employment and the Economy, Energy and Climate Roadmap 2050: https://tem.fi/documents/1410877/3437254/Energy+and+Climate+Roadmap+2050+14112014.pdf 11 Statistics Finland, December 2017, Finland's greenhouse gases made an upturn: https://www.sta t.fi/til/khki/2016/khki_2016_2017 - 12 - 08_tie_001_en.html 12 European Commission, Europe 2020 targets: statistics and indicators for Finland: https://ec.europa.eu/info/business - economy - euro/economic - and - fiscal - policy - coordination/eu - economic - governance - monito ring - prevention - correction/european - semester/european - semester - your - country/finland/europe - 2020 - targets - statistics - and - indicators - finland_en#share - of - renewable - energy,Second - Party Opinion OP Financial Group Green Bond 6 Impact of green buildings In 2012, h ousing was the main source of energy consumption from private use, accounting for 21.1% of Finland’s total energy end - use . 13 Thus Sustainalytics considers the improvement of e nergy performance of buildings to contribute to Finland’s GHG reduction target. In the absence of internationally recognized certifications (LEED, BREEAM etc.), OP Financial ’s eligibility criteria alternatively include new or recently built commercial or p ublic buildings with EPC B or higher in Finland , representing approximately 9 % of the Finnish commercial or public bui lding stock. 14 This approach will channel financing to the top energy efficient buildings in the country , as the eligible pool is tighter t han the Climate Bond Initiative’s recommendation of the top 15% of energy efficient buildings . OP Financial also intends to use the proceeds from the issuance of green bonds to improve the overall efficiency of the Finnish building stock by targeting renov ations and refurbishments of buildings that lead to either an improvement in EPC label or a 15% improvement in energy use as measured against the building code for the relevant structure. Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030.

While most of the proceeds are not used on a project basis, Sustainalytics considers OP Financial’s selection process for general purpose loans to be credible. In addition, the use of proceeds categories (i ) Renewable Energy, (ii) Energy Efficiency, (iii) Green Buildings, (iv) Pollution Prevention and Control (including Sustainable Water Management), (v) Sustainable Land Use and (vi) Clean Transportation are recognized as impactful by the Green Bond Principl es 2018 and includes credible third - party certification for green buildings and forest activities. Additionally, w hile a lookback period for refinancing is not disclosed, OP Financial commits to disclose the origination timeframe and maturity profile of th e loans per eligible criteria in its annual reporting . O P Financial’s p rocesses of project and business evaluation and selection as well as management of proceeds and reporting is aligned with market practice. Based on the above, Sustainalytics consider s that OP Financial is well positioned to issue green bonds and that the OP Financial Group Green Bond Framework is credible, robust and aligns with the four pillars of the Green Bonds Principles.,Second - Party Opinion OP Financial Group Green Bond 8 Appendices Appendix 1: Comparison of building certificatio n schemes BREEAM LEED "The Swan" Nordic Ecolabel 15 Type Certificate Certificate Certificate Background British Certification System; Adapted to Swedish regulations (BREEAM SE) used in Sweden since 2013; Used for new, refurbished and extension of ex isting buildings Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a US Certification System for residential and commercial buildings used worldwide.

Majority of BREEAM issues are flexible, meaning that the client ca n choose which to comply with to build their BREEAM performance score. BREAAM has two stages/ audit reports: a ‘BREEAM Design Stage’ and a ‘Post Construction Stage’, with different assessment criteria. Prerequisites (independent of level of certificati on) + Credits with associated points These points are then added together to obtain the LEED level of certification There are several different rating systems within LEED. Each rating system is designed to apply to a specific sector (e.g. New Constructi on, Major Renovation, Core and Shell Development, Schools - /Retail - /Healthcare New Construction and Major Renovations, Existing Buildings: Operation and Maintenance). Minimum thresholds to receive the Swan certification: For apartment buildings at least 17 out of 44 possible points must be achieved.

Both organizations are in line with international norms such as the International Labor Organization (ILO ) conventions, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In addition to compliance with laws in the country of certification, both schemes have a set of mi nimum requirements that companies are required to meet to obtain and maintain certifications. These requirements include compliance with standards around sustainable management of forests, management of environmental impact of operations, preservation of b iodiversity, management of socio - economic and community relations, and sourcing of sustainable wood (chain of custody). Furthermore, both FSC and PEFC require external annu al audits to ensure compliance, and achieve and maintain certification. Despite thes e similarities, PEFC has faced certain criticisms from civil society actors. These are highlighted below: (i) Type of organization: Since the FSC is an international labelling and certification system, it sets its own global standards. The PEFC, in contrast, is not a standard setter, but a mutual recognition scheme. The PEFC sets sustainability benchmarks according to international norms, and endorses national certification schemes that comply with these benchmarks. A common criticism of this model is that it allows for more flexibility in the interpretation of international PEFC benchmarks as per regional, cultural, and socio - economic context, and results in the endorsement of less rigorous national certification schemes. However, the process for being endorse d by the PEFC is thorough; any national certification system seeking to obtain PEFC endorsement must submit to a comprehensive assessment process, including independent evaluation and public consultation. This evaluation of compliance with international PE FC benchmarks is carried out by independent, accredited certification organizations. (ii) Indigenous People’s Rights: FSC and PEFC both identify indigenous rights as an important standard in forest management. Both certification schemes require that forest man agement activities consider and do not infringe on indigenous people’s rights, and the activities are carried out using frameworks ensuring their free and informed consent. A criticism of PEFC is that it requires only engagement with indigenous people in f orest management decisions, while the FSC provides performance - oriented targets, and requires forest managers operating on indigenous lands to obtain indigenous people’s consent through binding agreements. (iii) Sourcing wood from non - certified sources: Both F SC and the PEFC have established standards around sourcing wood from non - certified and controversial sources. FSC’s standards direct forest managers to avoid wood harvested in violation of traditional and civil rights. A criticism of the comparable PEFC st andard is that it limits identification of controversially sourced wood to situations where the local legislation is violated. However, PEFC standards explicitly reference the violation of local, national, and international legislation with regards to work er’s and indigenous people’s rights as being a controversial source of wood.,Second - Party Opinion OP Financial Group Green Bond 11 Appendix 3 : Green Bond / Green Bond Programme - External Review Form Section 1.
