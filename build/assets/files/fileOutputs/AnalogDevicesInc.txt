Green Bond Framework 3 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Analog Devices , Inc. Green Bond Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Analog Devices , Inc. Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the GBP 201 8 . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of ADI’s G reen B ond F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible categories for the use of proceeds – Renewable E nergy, Energy E fficiency, Green B uildings, Sustainable W ater and W astewater M anagement, Pollution P revention and C ontrol, Clean T ransportation and Eco - efficient and/or C ircular E conomy A dapted P roducts – are aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond Principles 2018. - Within the R enewable E nergy category, the Framework allows for expenditures related to the construction, development, acquisitio n, maintenance and operation of eligible renewable energy . § The Framework defines renewable energy as wind power, solar power, and geothermal power with direct emissions less than 100gCO 2 /kWh . 4 This is in line with market practice. § In addition to on - site renewable energy, t he Framework allows for allocating to the differential costs associated with sourcing renewable energy. Sustainalytics views positively that allocations in this category are directed solely to cost differences for renewable energy procur ement, not the entire amount, while encouraging ADI to prioritize procurement that is long - term and project - specific . - Within the E nergy E fficiency category , ADI will finance and/or refinance investments to increase the energy efficiency of its own operations. This includes projects such as LED lighting upgrades, pump upgrades, cooling tower upgrades, smart grids and energy storage. Sustainalytics views investments in the specified technology classes to ge nerate positive environmental impacts, and encourages reporting of quantitative impact metrics. - Proceeds from the green bond(s) will be used to finance expenditures related to properties that have received, or are expected to receive , LEED Gold certificat ion or higher for new construction or LEED Silver certification or higher for retrofitted buildings , or other equivalent certifications . § Sustainalytics views LEED certification as credible and aligned with market practice. S ee Appendix 2 for further description of LEED. § Sustainalytics considers LEED Gold and above as aligned with market practice , not ing that retrofitting existing buildings to the level of LEED Silver will generate positive environmental outcomes while encouraging the achievement of h igher levels of performance where feasible . - The Framework defines eligibility criteria for S ustainable W ater and W astewater M anagement assets in line with market practice . Sustainalytics encourages, where feasible, reporting on the quantitative impact of these projects. - The Pollution and Prevention Control category includes expenditures related to waste water treatment, waste prevention, waste reduction, waste recycling and associated environmental monitoring activities.

Sustainalytics views positively these efficiency improvements, noting that , as they are component technologies , no improvement threshold is considered in this analysis . It is also recognized that these technologies may be applied to hybrid vehicle s which, while generally less polluting than conventional internal combustion engines, may not be fully aligned with a low - carbon trajectory. 3 Nevertheless, as ADI’s investments are focused on improving the performance of subsystems within these vehicles, thus enabling a lesser reliance on fossil fuel combustion overall , these investments are viewed positively. § ADI may invest in the development of b attery management technologies whic h will provide improved energy performance in wireless applications. Sustainalytics views positively these efficiency improvements, noting that as they are component technologies that no quantitative threshold is considered in this analysis . § ADI may invest in the development of components which support and enable advanced telecommunications infrastructure, such as 5G. Sustainalytics recognizes the potential environmental benefits of widespread 5G deployment, which will deliver energy savings and o ther environmental benefits. However, Sustainalytics notes that (i) ADI’s technologies are implemented by third parties, and there fore the environmental benefits associated with its technologies will accrue across the value chain and (ii) ADI does not control the implementation, and therefore cannot guarantee that they are not being used in fossil - fuel intensive applications. - Also within the category of Eco - efficient products, e xpenditures may include research and development costs. Sustainalytics recognize s that R&D activities have the potential to result in positive environmental outcomes, while not ing the difficulty in quantifying the direct impacts of R&D related activities until the com mercialization phase , as well as that the GBP are commonly focused on project expenditures. Overall, ADI’s R&D expenditures are viewed positively based on : the disclosure of anticipated environmental benefits , the Company’s demonstrated track record of successfully implementing new and advanced technology, and the specific products targeted by the Framework for R&D activity are noted to be in deployment and/or near commercial stage. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - ADI’s Sustainability and Finance teams will be responsible for overseeing the Green Bond allocation and selection process. The teams will collectively nominate projects submitted by the Company’s various business units and will then recommend the allocatio n of eligible projects to the Treasurer who will be responsible for final project approval. - Based on the clear process for nominating projects and the final approval by senior member of the management team Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - ADI will monitor and keep track of the green bond(s) net proceeds in accordance with its internal tracking systems. ADI has communicated its intention to allocate net proceeds within the 24 month s after a green bond issuance, where feasible. - Pending full allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds, proceeds may be temporarily invested in cash or liquid securities accordance with ADI’s Investment Policy or used to repay existing debt . Consid ering the nature of ADI’s business activities and the defined allocation timeframe, Sustainalytics considers these forms of temporary investments as aligned with market practice. - Overall, based on the use of formal internal systems, as well as the disclosure of temporary investments and intended allocation timeframe , Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Reporting: 2 ADI has provided to Sustainalytics a list of projects which it is considering for inclusion in the inaugural green bond; Sust ainalytics considers these projects to be indicative of the undertakings to be financed under the Framework. 3 Sustainalytics cons iders an emissions threshold in CO2emitted per person - kilometer of mobility, as proposed by the IEA Mobility Model, to be indicative of compliance with a 2 - degree warming scenario.,Second - Party Opinion Analog Devices, Inc.

Allocation reporting will include (i) the amount of net proceeds allocated to each eligible project category, (ii) the list of eligible project categories with brief descriptions , and (iii) the outstanding amount of net proceeds that are yet to be allocated to projects at the end of the reporting period. Where feasible, ADI will also include impact reporting, drawing on metrics such as CO2e emissions avoided , certified green buildings floor area (sq.ft), renewable energy installed (capaci ty/savings kWh), greenhouse emissions avoided (metric tons CO2e, waste reduction (metric tons) and water savings (gal). - The Green Bond Report will be accompanied with management’s assertion that an amount equal to the net proceeds of an offering of bonds were allocated to eligible projects . This will be supplemented with a report from an independent registered public accounting firm in respect of its examination of management’s assert ions conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by th e American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. - Based o n the commitments outlined above, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that the Anal og Devices , Inc. Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP 201 8 . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 3 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Performance of Analog Devices , Inc. Contribution of framework to Analog Devices , Inc. ’s sustainability strategy Consider ing the focus on minimizing its impact to the environment, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that ADI has taken steps to integrat e sustainability considerations within its overall business operations . The Company’s environmental sustainability strategy focuses on monitoring and conserving the resources it uses within its production operations , namely energy, water, and materials, as part of its efforts to reduce discharges and emissions. In order to monitor its environmental performance, ADI routinely sets quantitative and time - bound goals and tracks ongoing progress in the following four focus areas: greenhouse gas, energy, water and waste. 4 Sustainalytics considers that t he proceeds of the green bonds issued under the Framework will directly contribute to Analog’s ability to fulfill its resource conservation goals . Analog initially set and met its 2010 goal of reducing GHG emissions, energy, water use and waste volume by 10% against a 2006 baseline and by 5% by 2015 against a 2010 baseline . ADI has set a new goal of achieving a further 2.5% reduction across the four metric s (GHG emissions, energy , water use and waste volume) by 2020 against a 2015 baseline. 5 In 2018, Analog’s absolute Scope 1 emissions decreased by 29% relative to 2015 , while normalized emissions (g/cm 2 of wafer fabricated) were reduced by 38% through the improvement of its abatement systems . 6 Between 2015 to 2018, ADI reduced its Scope 2 emissions by 34% as a result of shifting to renewable energy generation , as well as through energy efficiency and conservation initiatives . Since achieving these reductions, the Company has set a new target of a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025 against a 2015 baseline. In addition , the Company encourages its employees to reduce their own carbon footprints by providing shuttle bus services, prime parking spots for employees who carpool, and the use of teleconference and v ideoconference to reduce emissions associated with employee business travel. As a result of these efforts, the Company’s business travel category emissions under Scope 3 decreased by 52% in 2018 compared to 2017 levels . Regarding its energy usage and intensity, ADI’s purchased electricity and fuel – the Company’s main energy usage sources - decreased by 2% in 2018 against the 2015 baseline. In the same year, the Company’s electricity intensity at its wafer fabrication and assembly and test sites decreased by 11% and 9% respectively. 7 As discussed, the Company began using renewable energy in 2016 and 2017, at its Ireland and Philippines manufacturing sites respectively, resulting in decreased reliance on non - renewable energy sources. In 2018, 35 % of the energy used at its manufacturing sites were derived from renewable sources as compared to the 2015 baseline , and in the same year the Company installed zero - loss CDA heated dryer, lighting upgrades, var iable frequency drives, and pump upgrade projects , result ing in more than 16 million kWhr in energy savings. 4 Analog, Environmental Sustainability: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - sustainability.html 5 Analog, Environmental Sustainability: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - sustainability.html 6 Analog Devices, Greenhouse Gas: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - sustainability/greenhouse - gas.html 7 Analog Devices, Energy: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - sustainability/energy.html,Second - Party Opinion Analog Devices, Inc. Green Bond Framework 6 Despite ADI’s growth, the Company’s water usage has remained relatively constant with that of its base year . In 2018, the Company’s water use intensity at its wafer fabrication , assembly and test sites decreased by 10% and 15% respectively, against a 2015 baseline . O n average, 20% of the Company’s annual water withdrawal between 2015 to 2018 was reused or recycle d. 8 By focusing on water use reduction programs at its manufacturing facilities, with an emphasis on recycling and reuse, the Company recycled over 157 million gallons of water in 2018. 9 Given increased production, in 2018, waste generation (total waste ge nerated less recycled nonhazardous waste) increased by 1.2% against the 2015 baseline year . 10 However, the Company’s recycling rate for non - hazardous waste improved between 2015 and 2018 from 54% to 58%. 11 Given the abovementioned targets an d ADI’s ongoing commitment to improving its environmental practices across the four focus areas , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Analog Devices , Inc. Green Bond Framework will further the Company’s ability to fulfill its overall sustainability strategy and minimize its impact on the environme nt. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While it is acknowledged that the net proceeds from the bond(s) issued under ADI’s Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are expected to yield overall positive environmental impact, Sustainalytics recognizes that companies operating within the semiconductor industry face potential environmental and social risks , part icularly when considering the resource - intensive nature of the industry’s manufacturing process es . Some of these risks could include high amounts of water and energy depletion, the use of toxic chemicals in the manufacturing process, generation of hazardous waste, emission of harmful substances and occupational health and safety risks , namely exposure of workers to hazardous and harmful substances duri ng the manufacturing process. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that ADI can proactively manage and/or mitigate potential risks through the following policies and procedures: • ADI’s manufacturing sites are all certified to ISO 14001:2015, and the Company is in the process of transitioning to ISO 45001 . 12 In alignment with these certifications, the Company applies a n enterprise - wide Environmental Management System (EMS) and Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) policy, ensuring that ADI is meet ing internal and external compliance obligation s . 13 • ADI ha s procedures in place to ensure that relevant local, regional and global laws are followed with regards to the use of hazardous substances. The Company also sources materials that comply with restriction laws in countries where its products are used, and adheres to restrictions found in the European Union’s, as well as China’s, Restriction of Hazardous Substances (ROHS), Registration Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (REACH), and End of Life (ELV) Directives or China’s RoHS. 14 The Company has instated a compliance review board to monitor ongoing preparedness and conformance with legislation , and maintains regulatory registers and has programs in place to evaluate Environmental Health and Safety ( EHS ) compliance status . 15 The compliance management system is audited internally and externally and is certified by an independent third party. In addition, ADI’s facilities undergo routine inspections by government agencies to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Employees also receive EHS training, including prevention and risk control activities associated with their work. • As part of its commitment to employee health and safety, each ADI manufacturing site has an EH&S committee and /or work ing group which is comprised of representatives from different functioning groups across the Company . 16 ADI has also implemented a n enterprise - wide industrial hygiene 8 Analog Devices, Water: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - sustainability/water.html 9 Analog Devices, Water: https://www.analog.com/en/about - a di/sustainability/environmental - sustainability/water.html 10 Analog Devices, Waste: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - s ustainability/waste.html 11 Analog Devices, Waste: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - sustainability/waste.html 12 Analog Devices, Commitment to Management Systems and Structure: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - sustainability.html 13 Analog Dev ices, Commitment to Management Systems and Structure: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - sustainability.html 14 Analog Devices , Policies & Commitments: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - sustainability/policies - commitments.html 15 Analog Devices, Policies & Commitments: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - sustainability/policies - commitments.html 16 Analog Devices, Employee Health and Safety: https://w ww.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/employee - health - safety.html,Second - Party Opinion Analog Devices, Inc. Green Bond Framework 7 surveillance program that minimizes and prevents exposures in the workplace, reducing the risk of specific diseases. 17 • The EHS Director, who reports to the Senior Vice President (SVP) o f Global Operations and Technology, is responsible for compliance with applicable EHS legal requirements. 18 EHS Management convenes on a regular basis with ADI’s in - house counsel and with external counsel, advisors, and financial personnel to discuss potential environmental risks, including those to climate change, and possible impacts to ADI ’s overall business and operations. 19 • In order to ensure that its environmental goals remain relevant , ADI reviews and updates its environmental performance objectives annually, and reviews its goals on a quarterly basis at the corporate level , and on a monthly basis at the site level. Based on the outlined policies and protocols , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that ADI has implemented sufficient measures and is well positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible categories. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All eight use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP. Sustainalytics has focused below where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context. The impact of investing in energy efficiency , renewable energy and green buildings in the semiconductor manufacturing industry Studies show that in the United States, the semiconductor industry accounts for around 1.3% – 2% of energy consumption in the manufacturing sector. 20 According to research conducted by McKinsey & Company, the average semiconductor fabrication plant will consume as much power in a year as approxi mately 50,000 homes. 21 While larger fabrication plants often consume more electricity than auto mation plants and refineries , research suggests that facility and energy system upgrades can reduce energy costs and savings by approximately 30% for most fabrication plants. Examples of such measures include energy efficiency upgrades such as converting to LEDs as well as electric pump upgrades. In this context, ADI’s investments in the areas of energy - efficie ncy , renewable energy and green building s for its corporate facilities, products, and supply chain operations can result in significant reduction s in both the Company’s direct and indirect GHG emissions as well as its ability to operate in an energy efficient manner . An example of ADI’s past investments in these areas includes the Limerick Campus in Ireland, where the Company obtained LEED - Platinum certification. The building uses 100% renewable energy and includes energy efficient features such as intelligent park ing lot lighting, the use of sustainable building materials, r e use of materials where possible during the construction phase, low energy equipment, low global - warming potential (GWP) refrigerants and stormwater runoff filters in order to protect the quality of groundwater . To e nsure the Company’s energy savings performance is continuously improv ing , ADI conducts an energy efficiency audit every two years and implements recommendations . Based on the above, Sustainalytics believes that ADI’s investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy and certified - green buildings will have a positive environmental impact in the semiconductor industry. The importance of increased water efficiency and conservation in resource - intensive industries A portion of th e proceeds from the bond(s) issued under the Framework will be allocated to projects focused on water savings. As one of the world’s largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, water plays an integral role in the Company’s day - to - day operations. 22 A single 30cm wafer may require up to 2,200 gallons of water, including 1,500 gallons of ultra - pure water . A large fabrication facility that processes approximately 40,000 17 Analog Devices, Employee Health and Safety: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainab ility/employee - health - safety.html 18 Analog Devices, Environmental Sustainability: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - sustaina bility.html 19 Analog Devices, Environmental Sustainability: https://www.analog.com/en/about - adi/sustainability/environmental - sustainability.html 20 Smartwat t, Semiconducter Fabs: Chipping Away at Wasted Energy: https://www.smartwatt.com/semiconductor - fabs - chipping - away - at - wasted - energy/ 21 McKinsey & Company, Bringing energy efficiency to the fab: https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/op erations/pdfs/bringing_fabenergyefficiency.ashx 22 WaterWorld, Measurement of Ultra - Pure Water in the Semiconductor Industry: https://www.waterworld.com/technologies/article/16211282/measurement - of - ultrapure - water - in - the - semiconductor - industry,Second - Party Opinion Analog Devices, Inc. Green Bond Framework 8 wafers a month might use up to 4.8 million gallons of water per day, 23 roughly equiv alent to the water usage of a city of approximately 50,000 inhabitants. 24 Despite water being the largest fabrication input, and subsequently the largest contributor to fabrication plant waste, the tools for analyzing a fabrication facility’s water footprin t are generally considered to be less mature than tools for analyzing emissions related to CO 2 and other greenhouse gases. As such, it is paramount that companies operating water - intensive manufacturing plants address such issues. ADI monitors its water use intensity by normalizing its fabrication site’s water withdrawal to its production out put , and in 2018 successfully decreased water use in fabrication by 10% and in assembly and test by 15%. In this context, and in order to conti nue meetings its goals, ADI has implemented water use reduction programs across its various manufacturing sites. For example, at the Limerick campus, ADI has ongoing projects to reduce water consumption and reuse water streams where possible, including rec ycle of RO (Reverse Osmosis) and UF (Ultra - Filtration) concentrate within the site water plant. Considering the above, Sustainalytics view ADI’s investments in the category of Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management positively and encourages ADI to dis close its water usage by site and routinely update associated figures in order to ensure greater transparency. The impact of the semiconductor industry in enabling energy sa v in g s Given the wide application of the devices developed by ADI, innovations in semiconductor processes and performance have the potential to enable increased environmental performance across a number of industries . Through increased innovation, the feasibility of introducing energy - saving technologies has become more mainstream, allowing the industry , and those in affiliation, to undergo a collective shift towards more eco - efficient and green practices. For example, ADI presently offers a battery formation control system solution that optimizes an efficient energy recycling feature , allow ing for positive energy savings impacts within its own large scale battery manufacturing processes while also enabling increased energy savings for the hybrid and electric vehicles in which the recharge able batteries will be installed . 25 The solution offers a power efficiency higher than 90%, while during battery formation and grading, the energy discharged can be recycled in the process for other batteries. 26 In this context, ADI’s investments in energy - saving technologies such as battery management systems , including sensors and monitors, will advance energy - efficient performance across a broad range of devices and applications . Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030.

Green Bond Framework 17 ☐ Other (please specify): Review provider(s): Date of publication: ABOUT ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP i. Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures , such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an as sessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds fro m Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a re cognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an establi shed scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion Analog Devices, Inc.
