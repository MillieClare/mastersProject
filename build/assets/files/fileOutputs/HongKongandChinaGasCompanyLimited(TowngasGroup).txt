INTRODUCTION The Hong Kong and C hina Gas Company Limited ( “ Hong Kong and China Gas ”, commonly known as “Towngas Group” ) engages in the production, distribution and marketing of gas in Ho ng Kong and Mailand China . The company also acts as a pip ed city - gas operator and serves 21 million re sidential, commer cial and industrial customers. Hong Kong and China Gas operates LPG filling stations, landfill gas utilization projects, aviation fuel storage facility and onshore oil field projects, with a more recent focus on the development of new ener gy projects covering resource exploitation, liquefaction of coalbed methane, coal - bas ed chemicals and biomass energies. Hong Kong and China Gas also operates as a utility contractor for water, drainage, sewerage, electricity and telecommunications projects . The company was founded in 1862 and it is based in North Point, Hong Kong. Hong Kong and China Gas has developed a Green Bond Framework 1 (the “Hong Kong and China Gas Green Bond Framework”) under which it will issue a green bond and use the proceeds t o finance and / or refinance expenditures related to non - fossil fuel energy investments in the following areas: (i) landfill gas projects; (ii) biomass waste - to - energy projects , (iii) waste treatment projects; (iv ) wastewater treatment projects; and (v) any other eligible projects targeting the production of energy from renew able or sustainable sources and /or improvements in the energy efficiency of the company’s non - fossil fuel operations. Hong Kong and China Gas has engaged Sustainalytics to provide a sec ond opinion on its framework and the framework’s environmental credentials. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversat ion s with various members of H ong Kong and China Gas’ management team to understand the sustainability impact of their busi ness processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as the management of proce e ds and reporting aspects of the issuer’s green bond framework. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contain s Sustai nalytics’ o pinion on the Hong K ong and China Gas Green Bond Framework and should be read in conjuction with that framework. 1 Available at http://www.towngas.com/en/Green - Bond/towngas - green - bond - framework,© Sustainalytics 2017 4 2. SUSTAINALYTICS’ OPIN ION Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Hong Kong and China Gas Green Bond Framework Su mmary Overall, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Hong Kong and China Gas Green Bond Framework is transparent and robust and aligns with four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2017. 2 Some considerations for this assessment include:  Sustainalyti cs is of the opinion that , although Hong Kong and China Gas is a fossil - fuel based company, it has demonstrated a n intention to transition away from less - brown fo ssil - fuel sources (such as natural gas) to a waste - to - energy approach. In Sustainalytics’ view , such a transition could be strengthened by adding quantitative and timebound targets with respect to the percent age of its e lectricity production that it generates from non - fossil fuel sources. Given that the Hong Kong and China Gas Green Bond Framework does not finance any fossil - fuel operations, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Hong Kong and China Gas Green Bond Framework contributes to the company’s signalled intention to transition towards non - fossil - fuel - based energy production . See Section 2 for more details.  Waste Treatment, Waste - T o - E nergy projects, Wastewater Treatment, along with Renewable Energy and non - fossil - fuel - based Energy Efficiency projects , are recognized by the Green Bond Principles as categories wi th clear environmental bene fits. Given that proceeds from the Hong Kong and China Gas Green Bond Framework will not be directed towards fossil - fuel - reliant operations or projects, Sustainalytics views these projects as beneficial (for additional information on impact see Section 3 ).  Hong Kong and China Gas involves multiple dec ision - making corporate bodies for identifying and evaluating Eligible Green Bond Projects. The company’s Green Bond Committee, comprising members of the senior executive team as well as the Chief Financial O fficer, are in charge of the final approval of the eligible projects. 3 Moreover, Hong Kong and China Gas implemented a Green Development Steering Committee which is chaired by the company’s Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer. 4 Both of these com mittees have ‘C - level’ involvement , which Sustainalytics views as market best practice . 2 “The Green Bond Principles 2017”, dated 2 June 2017, issued by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) 3 Green Bond Framework ava ilable at http://www.towngas.com/en/Green - Bond/towngas - green - bond - framework 4 Sustainability Report 2016 - https://www.towngas.com/getmedia/bdcae171 - 1bd 2 - 4105 - bfbd - 89ce270c191c/sr_2016_e.pdf.aspx,© Sustainalytics 2017 5  The disclosure and processes defined in the Hong Kong and China Gas Green Bond Framework with respect to the management of proceeds are in line t he Green Bond Princip les 2017 and reflect market practice s . Use of Proceeds  Hong Kong and China Gas confirmed to Sustainalytics that , for proceeds used to increas e the energy efficiency of its non - fossil - fuel - based operations, it will target a 5% increase in energy efficienc y in the next 3 - 5 years. Sustainalytics recognizes that the green bond market may expect greater efficiency gains like 20%, and recommends that Hong Kong and China Gas strive for greater energy efficiency gains in its non fossil - fuel based operations.  Wit h respect to waste - water treatment projects, Hong Kong and China Gas has confirmed to Sustainalytics that proceeds will be directed to projects that improve water quality beyond what is legally required by the Chinese national standard.  Proceeds directed to biofuel production will follow the waste - to - energy approach, mitigating the environmental and social risk of using viable food or forestry products for the production of energy. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 2017 Sustainalytics has determined that the Hong Kong and China Gas Green Bond Framework aligns to the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2017. For detailed information please refer to Appendix 3: Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Sect ion 2 : Sustainability Performance of t he Issue r Hong Kong and China Gas articulates a commitment to environmental protection in its mission statement, which is to provide its customers with a safe and reliable supply of energy while protecting and improving the environment. 5 The company also has a vision to be Asia’s leading energy supplier with an environmental l y - friendly focus . 6 Hong Kong and China Gas ’s commitment is also made evident through having managerial - level responsi bility for environmental issues. For example, the company has impl emented a Green Development Steering Committee under the direct oversight of the managing director of Hong Kong and China Gas . 7 Hong Kong and China Gas has made progress toward delivering on this commitment by achieving a 23% reduction in GHG emissions p er unit of gas produced from its Hong Kong production, compared to the baseline year of 2005, 8 and a 90% reduction in construction waste . 9 The company also implemented the decarbonization of its operations throughout Hong Kong and Mainland China by launchi ng a Carbon 5 http://www.towngaschina.com/en/About - Us/Vision - and - Mission 6 http://www.towngaschina.com/en/About - Us/Vision - and - Mission 7 Sustainability Report 2016 - https://www.towngas.com/getmedia/bdcae171 - 1bd2 - 4105 - bfbd - 89ce270c191c/sr_2016_e.pdf.aspx 8 Sustainability Report 2016 - https://www.towngas.com/getmedia/bdcae171 - 1bd2 - 4105 - bfbd - 89ce270c191c/sr_2016_e.pdf.aspx 9 Annual Report 2016 - ttps://www.towngas.com/ getmedia/866bcd86 - b8ea - 441d - 8c60 - 04d265a12481/AR2016 - Eng_Full.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf,© Sustainalytics 2017 6 Reduction Competition, which resulted in 64,500 tonnes of avoided carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Sustainalytics recognizes that Hong Kong and China Gas ’s emission s reduction i s still partially reliant on lower - emission fossil fuels such as natural gas. However, Hong Kong and China Gas also demonstrates that it is taking steps to transition away from fossil - fuel energy sources. Hong Kong and China Gas ’s n ew ECO energy platform 10 , through which it has developed various non - fossil - fuel - base d waste - to - energy production facilities , is indicative of these steps. Hong Kong and China Gas has also reported that its investments into landfill gas treatment facilities at the South East New Territories (SENT) and the North East New Territories (NENT) landfill sites helped to reduce the company’s carbon emissions by an additional 56,000 tonnes a year, and estimated that the latter facility would increase the share of landfill gas to 5% of the company’s local energy production in Hong Kong. 11 Sustainaly tics is of the opinion that , although Hong Kong and China Gas is a fossil - fuel - based company, it has demonstrated a n intention to transition away from fossil - fuel sources to a waste - emergy approach. In Sustainalytics’ view, such a transition could be stren gthened by adding quantitative and timebound targets with respect to the percent of the company’s energy production that it generates from non - fossil - fuel sources. Given that the Hong Kong and China Gas Green Bond Framework does not finance any fossil - fuel operations, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Hong Kong and China Gas Green Bond Framework contributes to the company’s transition away from fossil - fuel energy. Well positioned to mitigate common Environmental and Soc ial risks associated with en ergy production Besides respecting all laws and regulations in place in Hong Kong and Mainland China, the company implemented a Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Policy as well as a Total Quality Management (TQM) programme that strives for a holisti c management of environmental and social risks specific to a n energy producer and utilities company. 12 Sustainalytics views positively the following risk management criteria: (i) Hong Kong and China Gas’ HSE policy is implemented across the company with the pu rpose of reinforcing the company’s sustainability strategy. The HSE policy comprises a Process Hazard Analysis through which Hong Kong and China Gas evaluates the potential causes and impacts of operational incidents and determines any necessary critical c ontrols ; (ii) Hong Kong and China Gas’ implemented a Total Quality Management programme in Mainland China so as to improve operational safety standards, work quality and services ; the company received two gold awards from the 15 th Hong Kong Occupational Safety and Health Award in recognition of its efforts to improve safety management standards; 10 https://www.towngas.com/getmedia/866bcd86 - b8ea - 441d - 8 c60 - 04d265a12481/AR2016 - Eng_Full.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf 11 https://www.towngas.com/getmedia/9bc8b39f - 2517 - 4842 - 862a - 1fb2a82de91e/TGSD_ FullReport_2016_en.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf 12 Sustainability Report 2016 - https://www.towngas.com/getmedia/bdcae171 - 1bd2 - 4105 - bfbd - 89ce270c191c/sr_2016_e.pdf.aspx,© Sustainalytics 2017 7 (iii) The HSE Policy is developed around the prescriptions of recognized standards such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 . (iv) Hong Kong and China Gas has implemented a Stak eholder Engagement programme to help assess the sustainability performance of the company and identify the key topics of sustainability relevance for the company’s stakeholders. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the health, safety and environmental po licies and programmes outlined above enable the company to identify and mitigate social and environmental risks associated with Eligible Green Projects. Section 3 : Impact of Use of Proceeds Importance of waste - to - energy projects in China Hong Kong’s u rbanization rate of 100% in 2017, along with China’ s urbanization rate of 57.9% 13 (which is projected to reach 80% by 2030 14 ) have been cor r elated with increases in energy consumption and pollution rates . 15 However, utilities companies such as Hong Kong and C hina Gas have dedicated capital expenditures for the deployment of waste - to - energy technologies in order to better capitalize on new market opportunities and co ntribute to China’s national targets to divert a third of its waste to waste - to - energy plants by 2030 . 16 Sustainalytics believes that Hong Kong and China Gas’ proposed landfill gas treatment facility in Tseung Kwan O (Hong Kong) , along with the company’ s proposed waste - to - energy facilities in Zhangjiagang (China) and Suzhou (China) , will positively contribute to China’s national target to increase the share of clean energy to 15% by 2020 and to 30% by 2030. 17 Moreover, Sustainalytics estimates that Hong Kong and China and Gas ’ waste - to - energy projects will also have a positive impact in lowering China ’s anthropogenic emissions of methane – a highly potent GHG – from landfills . It is estimated that the proposed projects would also help support China’s efforts to reduce its reliance on coal - fired electricity production and thereby have an indirect positi ve impact o n the country’s air quality. Separately, Sustainalytics believes that Hong Kong and China Gas’ proposed agricultural waste processing plant in Hubei, China would also have a significant positive impact o n air quality in the agriculture - depende nt communities in China that traditionally practice open - field burning of their agricultural waste. While the opinion of the scientific community is that the negative impact of open - field burning has been generally underestimated in China , 18 local authoriti es have recognized these practices as having a severe environmental and social impact and have established national plans to 13 https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the - world - factbook/fields/2212.html 14 https://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/Country - Profiles/ 15 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3733467/ 16 https://e360.yale.edu/features/as - china - pushes - waste - to - ener gy - incinerators - protests - are - mounting 17 https://www.reeep.org/projects/china - roadmap - 30 - renewable - energy - penetration - 2030 18 https://www.nature.com/articles/srep32307,© Sustainalytics 2017 8 modernize its agricultural practices. 19 Under China’s 13 th Five - Year Plan, the local government supports targeted environmental effo rts including carbon emission reduction, pollutants emission reduction, smog reduction and clean energy promotion. It is Sustainalytics ’ opinion that Hong Kong and China Gas’ proposed project in Hubei would positively contribute to tackling China’s air qua lity challenges and contribute to China’s biomass - to - energy national policies and its energy diversification commitments . Importance of wastewater treatment projects in China China’s accelerated urbanization rates and rapid economic growth has been gen erating environmental degradation, most visible in the area of water pollution, due to uncontrolled wastewater discharges. The Chinese government recognized the negative environmental impacts associated wit h wastewater discharges, it imposed a Water Pollut ion Prevention and Control Act ion Plan and it placed the country’s most eastern main rivers and water bodies into the Class V category, a level at which the water is considered too polluted for any uses. 20 However, China’s Water Pollution Prevention and Con trol Action Plan 21 includes ten measures as well as specific indicators that emphasize the markets’ role in tackling water pollution. It is Sustainalytics ’ opinion that Hong Kong and China Gas’ proposed wastewater treatment projects have a strong potential to capitalize on new market opportunities and are aligned with China’s efforts to address wastewater practices. Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. Hong Kong and China Gas’ Green Bond Framework advances the following SDG goals and targets: U se o f P roceeds Category SDG SDG target Landfill gas collection and treatment (renewable energy) SDG 7: Aff ordable and Clean Energy 7.1 By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services 7.1.2 Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix 7.2.1 Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption Waste - to - energy (renewable energy) SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy 7.1 By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy ser vices 7.1.2 Proportion of population with primary reliance 19 http ://www.cn.undp.org/content/china/en/home/presscenter/articles/2017/05/19/undp - participates - in - china - biomass - energy - forum - 2017.html 20 https://journals.cd rs.columbia.edu/wp - content/uploads/sites/25/2016/10/70 - 343 - 1 - PB.pdf 21 http://english.gov.cn/policies/latest_releases/2015/04/16/content_281475090170164.h tm,© Sustainalytics 2017 9 on clean fuels and technology 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix 7.2.1 Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption Wastewa ter treatment SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation 6.3 By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially inc reasing recycling and safe reuse globally 6.3.1 Proportion of wastewater treated safely Conclusion Hong Kong and China Gas has developed a Green Bond Framework under which it intends to issue green bonds. Proceeds of the bonds will be used to finance or refinance expenditures related to investments in the company’s utilities and gas - production assets with the aim of improving their environmental performance , specifically projects relating to: (i) landfill gas projects; (ii) biomass waste - to - energy proj ects, (iii) waste treatment projects; (iv) wastewater treatment projects; and (v) any other eligible projects targeting the production of energy from renewable or sustainable sources and/or improvements in the energy efficiency of the company’s non - fossil fuel operations.
