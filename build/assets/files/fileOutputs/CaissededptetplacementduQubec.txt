© Sustainalytics 20 2 1 Second - Party Opinion Caisse de d é p ô t et placement du Qu é bec Green Bond Framework Evaluation Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec ( “ CDPQ ” ) Green Bond Framework is credible , impactful and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018 . This assessment is based on the following: The eligible categories for the use of procee ds - Renewable Energy, Clean Transport ation , Energy Efficiency , Pollution Prevention and Control , Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management and Forest, Agricultural Land and Land Management - are aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond Pri nciples . Sustainalytics considers that the eligible categories will lead to positive environmental or social impacts and advance the U N Sustainable Development Goals , specifically SDG Goals 6, 7 , 11, 12 and 15. Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (“CDPQ”) has est ablished a Green Bond working group to evaluate and select eligible investments. The working group is comprised of representatives from the climate risk s and issues , investment stewardship , treasury , asset management , l egal a ffairs and public affairs teams . CDPQ’s Liquidity and Funding Management Committee will be responsible for final approval. Sustainalytics considers the project selection process to be in line with market practice. CDPQ’s treasury department will be responsible for maintaining a Green Bond Register and will allocate an amount equivalent to the Green Bond net proceeds to eligible investments. The register will be reviewed annually by the G reen Bond working group, and pending allocation, unallocated proceed s may be temporarily invested in high quality liquid assets in the form of government bonds , money market securities and/or cash . CDPQ intends to allocate within 12 months of issuance. Thi s is in line with market practice. CDPQ has committed to issuing an annual Green Bond report until full allocation. The report will include the allocation of net proceeds in aggregate and at the category level, the share of fina ncing versus refinance and the amount of unallocated proceeds, if applicable . In addition, CDPQ is committed to reporting on relevant impact metrics, where feasible. Sustainalytics views CDPQ’s allocation and impact reporting as aligned with market practic e.

CDPQ invests the funds received from its depositors in four primary asset classes (Fixed Income, Real Assets, Equities and Other Investments). As of December 31, 2020 , CDPQ manage d assets for over 4 0 depositors and , had more than CAD 3 65 billion in assets under management , with nearly two thirds of its assets invested internationally. CDPQ has developed the CDPQ Green Bond Framework (the “F ramework ”) under which CDP Financial Inc, a wholly - owned subsidiary of CDPQ, intends to issue green bond s and use the proceeds toward existing or future investments that finance activities that reduce GHG emissions and energy consumption and improve resource efficiency. The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in six areas: 1. Renewable Energy 2. Clean Transport a tion 3. Energy Efficiency 4. Pollution Prevention and Control 5. Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management 6. Forest, Agricultural Land and Land Management CDPQ engaged Sustainalytics to review the CDPQ Green Bond Framework , dated April , 202 1 , and provide a S econd - P arty O pinion on the Framework’s environmental and social credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018 ( GBP 2018 ) . 1 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 2 Scope of work and limitations of Sus tainalytics Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent 3 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are credible a nd impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • The Framework’s alignment with the ICMA Green Bond Principles 2018 • The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds • The alignment of the issuer’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.3 , which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of CDPQ ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business pro cesses and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. CDPQ representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of CDPQ to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ 2 The CDPQ Green Bond Framework is available on Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec ’s website at: https://cdpq.com/en/investor - relations 3 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustainalytics and ensuring analyst independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust con flict management framework that specifically addresses the need fo r analyst independence, consistency of process, structural separation of commercial and research (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcom es. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparency.,Second - Party Opinion CDPQ Green Bond Framework 3 (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - publ ic information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. Any update of the present Second - Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Su stainalytics and CDPQ . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, S ustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed und er the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the intended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee the realized allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No informat ion provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or argument either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and re lated surrounding circumstances that CDPQ has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second - Party Opinion . Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the CDPQ Green Bond Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the CDPQ Green Bond Framework is credible , impactful and aligns with the four core components of the GBP 2018. Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of CDPQ ’s Green Bond Framework : • Use of Proceeds: - The elig ible categories – Renewable Energy, Clean Transportation, Energy Efficiency, Pollution Prevention and Control, Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management and Forest, Agricultural Land and Land Management – are aligned with those recognized by the GBP 2018. - Sustainalytics notes that CDPQ has specified within its Framework that eligible investments shall meet relevant thresholds defined by the associated Climate Bond Sector Criteria and Climate Bond Taxonomy as of March 2021 . The Framework outlines that investments may also include loans to and direct investments in companies that derive at least 90% of their revenues from sources that meet the eligibility criteria. By placing a threshold, Sustainalytics believes that CDPQ has ensured that proceeds from the green bond(s) will be directed t o environmental activities that generate positive impact. - Within the “Renewable e nergy” category, CDPQ intends to allocate bond proceeds to projects that will supply renewable energy from sources including wind, solar , marine , geothermal and hydropower . Sustainalytics notes the following: § Geothermal projects will be expected to result in direct emissions below 100 grams of C O 2 per kilowatt - hour (CO 2 /kWh) . § Eligible hydropower projects must have a power density of more than 5 watts per square meter or lifecycle emissions of less than 100 grams of CO 2 /kWh if it became operational before January 1, 2020 and must have a power density of more than 10 watts per swaure meter or lifecycle emissions of less than 50 grams of CO 2 /kWh if it became operational after January 1, 2020 . § Infrastructure for the purpose of renewable energy or energy efficiency integration is eligible if at least 90% of the electricity used is derived from renewable sources.,Second - Party Opinion CDPQ Green Bond Framework 4 - Within the “Clean T ransportation” category, CPDQ intends t o finance low - carbon passenger and freight transportation al ong with supporting infrastructure. Sustainalytics notes that CDPQ intends for all low - carbon transportation projects to meet the Climate Bonds Initiative’s threshold for low - carbon transport, which is less than 25 grams of CO 2 per ton ne - kilometer (gCO 2 /t - km) for freight and less than 50 grams of CO 2 per passenger - kilometer (gCO2/p - km) for passenger vehicles. - The “Energy Efficiency” category considers investments in equipment or technology that will result in a minimum of 20% in energy savings. Such projects include smart grid, district heating and cooling, energy storage and efficient lighting. Sustainalytics notes the inclusion of a minimum energy improvement threshold positively and considers these projects to be in line with market practice. CDPQ has confirmed that district heating projects financed with green bond proceeds will not include projects where the energy is derived from fossil fuel sources. CDPQ has also confirmed that heating, cooling and co generation projects using biomass or biofuel will comply with th e Climate Bonds Initiative criteria for energy efficiency. CDPQ has confirmed that f eedstocks used will be sustainable , including being certified under best practice certification standards such as Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials ( RSB ) , Roundtable on Responsible Soy ( RT RS ) , Forest Stewardship Council ( FSC ) and International Sustainability Carbon Certific ation ( ISCC Plus ) . Sustainalytics has communicated to CDPQ that cogeneration from bioenergy sources should emit less than 100 grams of CO 2 /kWh for electricity and less than 30 grams of CO 2 /kWh for heat. - The “Pollution Prevention and Control” category include s investments in waste management activities such as waste prevention, waste reduction and waste recycling as well as equipment or technologies aimed at reducing air emissions associated with greenhouse gases . Sustainalytics notes that such technologies will be limited to direct air capture. - Within the “Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management” category , CDPQ intends to invest in water infrastructure projects , such as water network and equipment for efficient water supply, distribution and storage, as well as water treatment and rainwater harvesting projects. Sustainalytics considers this to be in line with market practice. - Within the “Forest, Agricultural La nd and Land Management” categor y, CDPQ intends to finance projects in the areas of reforestation, sustainable forest management, and natural forests . - CDPQ will use international ly recognized certification schemes such FSC, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) or equivalent standards to determine eligibility for all sustainable forestry projects . See Appendix 1 for Sustainalytics’ assessment of these programs . For investment in agriculture and land management projects, including cultivating eligible forested land, Sustainalytics notes that the Framework excludes livestock production and the use of general - purpose road vehicles. This category also includes investments in information systems and assoc iated technologies supporting precision agriculture and resource efficiency. - CDPQ has listed the following as exclusionary criteria : nuclear power generation; weapons and munitions; fossil fuels; and tobacco. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that these exclusions strengthen the Framework. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - CDPQ has established a Green Bond working group to evaluate a nd select eligible investments. The working group is comprised of representatives from various team s , including climate risks and issues , investment stewardship, t reasury, asset management , l egal a ffairs and public affairs . Once the working group has compl eted initial eligibility evaluation and selection, CDPQ’s Liquidity and Funding Management Committee will be responsible for final approval. - The Green Bond working group will, on a best effort basis, substitute additional green assets for any assets that are no longer eligible. The working group will also be responsible for approving allocations of net proceeds as well as any future updates to the Framework. - CDPQ intends to allocate within 12 months of issuance and has defined a look - back period of 24 months prior to the date of issuance. - Sustainalytics considers the project selection process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds:,Second - Party Opinion CDPQ Green Bond Framework 5 - CDPQ’s treasury department will be responsible for maintaining a Green Bond Register and will allocate an amount equivalent to the Green Bond net proceeds to eligible investments. The register will contain relevant information associated with eac h green bond issuance, such as eligible investments names, categories and allocation amounts. The register will be reviewed annually by the Green Bond working group . - P ending allocation, unallocated proceeds may be temporarily invested in high quality liquid assets in the form of government bonds , money market securities and/or cash . - Sustainalytics conside rs this process to be in line with market practice. • Reporting: - CDPQ has committed to issuing a publicly available Green Bond report on an annual basis until full allocation. The report will include both allocation and impact reporting. - Regarding allocation, the report will detail the allocation of net proceeds in aggregate and at the category level, the share of financing versus refinance , and the amount of unallocated proceeds, if applicable . - Regarding impact reporting, the report will aggregate relevant quantitative impact metrics and qualitative performance descriptions, on a selection of eligible investments and subject to confidentialit y considerations . S ample impact measures include amount of renewable energy generated ; decrease in water use, annual energy saved , and greenhouse gas emissions reduced or avoided , and number of people provided with access to clean power. - Until the full allocation of proceeds, CDPQ will engage a third party to conduct an annual verification of its allocation of net proceeds to eligible green investments and reporting metrics. The au ditor will be responsible for verifying that the net proceeds have been allocated to eligible investments or otherwise invested in approved financial instruments. - Sustainalytics conside rs CDPQ’s reporting process to be in line with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 2018 Sustainalytics has determined that t he CDPQ Green Bond Framework align s with the four core components of the GBP 201 8. For detailed information please refer to Appendix 2: Green Bond /Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Performance of CDPQ Contribution of Framework to CDPQ’s sustainability strategy CDPQ formally started its responsible investment journey in 1994 when it published its first shareholder voting policy. In 2004, it published its first responsible investment policy and two years later became one of the founding members of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment. In 2017 , CDPQ developed a climate change strategy in alignment with its overarching mission of supporting the transition towards a sustainable economy through its investments. The strategy , which covers the entire portfolio, is built on four key pillars : factoring in climate change considerations into each of its investment decisions; increasing its low - carbon investments by 80% between 2017 and 2020; reducing the carbon footprint per dollar invested by 25% between 2017 and 20 2 5; and exercising stronger climate leadership within the industry and through dialogue wi th the companies in its portfolio. CDPQ achieved its 2020 goal of increasing low - carbon investments by 80% by achieving a 95% increase compared to 2017. In 2019, CDPQ became a founding member of the United Nations Net - Zero Asset Owner Alliance, pledging to transition its investment portfolios to net - zero GHG emissions by 2050. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the green bonds issued under the CDPQ Green Bond Framework will directly contribute to CDPQ’s ability to fulfill the goals associated with its cl imate change strategy . CDPQ provides annual progress updates in its stewardship investing repor t , the most recent of which captures its progress in 2019 . 4 This report details that CDPQ exceeded its initial target t o increas e low - carbon investments by 50% by 202 0 , from a baseline of CAD 18 billion in 2017 . In 2018, CDPQ increased its 2020 4 CDPQ, 201 9 Stewardship Investing Report, https://www.cdpq.com/sites/default/files/medias/pdf/en/ra/id2019_rapport_investissement_durable_en.pdf,Second - Party Opinion CDPQ Green Bond Framework 6 target to 80 %, translating into a renewed target of CAD 32 billion in low - carbon investments by 2020. As of 2019, the low - carbon asset portfolio totaled CAD 34 billion, up 95% over 2017. In line with the third pillar of its climate change strategy , in 2017 CDPQ became the first institutional investor (among its peer group) to commit to reducing the carbon intensity of its global portfolio and , as of 2018 , is on track to meet its 2025 goal of reducing its carbon footprint by 25% with a 10 % reduction in its portfolio’s carbon intensity . I n 2018, CDPQ assessed climate risk by measuring the carbon intensity of 150 investment opportunities and their impact on the carbon intensity of the overall portfolio. In order to ensure it mee ts its objective s , CDPQ set carbon intensity budgets and targets for its in vestment portfolios and has linked the variable compensation of all employees withi n the organization to the achievement of these targets . As of 2017, the reference year for future reductions, approximately three - quarters of CDPQ’s portfolio was made up of low - or very low - intensity assets as defined by CDPQ . Based on the above, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the CDPQ Green Bond Framework is aligned with its climate change strategy and sustainable development efforts and will further CDPQ ’s ability to fulfill its net - zero GHG emissions commitment. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the use of proceeds from the Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are anticipated to have positive environmental impacts, it is important to acknowledge that the eligible activities may be associated with environmental and/or social risks. Some key risks associated with the eligible green investments include, land use change and biodiversity loss associated with large - scale infrastructure development such as renewable energy facilities , and risks related t o occupational health and safety and the potential impact to local communities. While Sustainalytics acknowledges that as an investor, CDPQ has a limited role in the development and operations of specific eligible activities which they are financing under the Framework , we note that CDPQ has policies and procedures in place during the investment decision - making process to help mitigate and manage potential risks that may arise. CDPQ manages the environmental risks of their investments through the application of an enterprise - wide Policy on Responsible Investment (the “Policy”) 5 . One of the guiding principles of the Policy is to encourage companies financed by CDPQ to take necessary measures to respect and to protect the environment in which they operate. The Policy also outlines the steps CDPQ takes to integrate environmental criteria into the investment analysis and decision - making process in order to systematically consider all risks and opportunities associated with potential invest ments. CDPQ ’s Board of Directors is responsible for approving the Policy, while the Responsible Investment Committee is charged with reviewing the activities related to responsible investment and to make necessary recommendations to CDPQ’s Executive Commit tee. As noted in the Policy’s guiding principles, CDPQ encourages companies to respect workers’ rights ; to guarantee workers a safe working environment ; to prohibit any form of abuse ; and to respect the communities where they carry out their operations. These factors are also taken into consideration through integration of social risk mitigation criteria in the investment analysis and decision - making process as discussed above . CDPQ manages its own occupational health and safety risk through its Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct 6 which applies to all officers and employees of CDPQ. CDPQ s tates that it proactively engages with its stakeholders through dialogue with board members and officers and through exercising proxy voting rights as a shareholder . It is also committed to undertak ing a collaborative approach to engaging with investor net works in the area of responsible investment , and is a member of a number of key organizations in this area , including the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, the Carbon Disclosure Project, the CDP Water Disclosure Project, the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, the Canadian Coalition for Good Governance and the Pension Investment Association of Canada. CDPQ applies a Policy on the Principles Governing the Exercise of Voting Rights of Public 5 CDPQ, Policy on Responsible Invest ment: https://www.cdpq.com/sites/default/files/medias/pdf/en/politique_investissement_responsable_en.pdf 6 CDPQ, Code of Ethics and Professio nal Conduct: https://www.cdpq.com/sites/default/files/medias/pdf/en/code_ethique_dirigeants_employes_en.pdf,Second - Party Opinion CDPQ Green Bond Framework 7 Companies 7 t hat provides its management teams and employees a guide for exercising voting rights with adherence to sound governance practices. Based on these policies and procedure s , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that CDPQ has implemented appropriate measures and is well positi oned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible categories . Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All six use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP 2018. Sustainalytics has foc used below where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context. The role of institutional investors in supporting a transition to a low - carbon economy Institutional investors are both susceptible to climate change risk and uniquely positioned t o take actions which will lead to positive impact. With vast portfolio exposure across the global economy, the implications of climate change are systemic and readily apparent with the number of extraordinary weather events increasing annually and leading to significant long - term financial and human consequences, including a rise in third - party liability claims for insurance companies and physical damages associated with climate change. 8 As a n institutional investor with a long - term investment horizon, such events will impact CDPQ’s ability to provide the economic returns for its depositors . In addition to their expos ure to climate change risk s , institutional investors are well - positioned to support investments that enable climate resilience. According to a report conducted by the International Renewable Energy Agency in 2018, 9 under current plans and policies, meeting the 1.5 °C pathway would require a doubling of current annual investments in clean technologies. In this context, and with more than CAD 3 65 billion in net assets under management as at December 31, 2020 , CDPQ is well - placed to seize attractive opportunities provided by the energy transition by scal ing up long - term green investment, redirecting the flow of finance towards building socio - economic resilience to mitigate and cope with the effects of climate change. In this context, financing initiatives that mitigate climate risk, naturally aligns with the business objectives for many long - term, institutional investors , such as CDPQ . Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2 030. This green bond advances the following SDG goals and targets : Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Renewable Energy 7.

S ustainalytics considers that the pr ojects funded by the green bond proceeds will enable a reduction in GHG emissions and energy consumption and notes that the use of proceeds categories are recognized by the Green Bond Principles 2018. The CDPQ Green Bond Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Sustainalytics believes that the CDPQ Green Bond Framework is aligned with CDPQ’s overall sustainability strategy and that the use of proceeds categories will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goa ls 6, 7, 11, 12 and 15. Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that CDPQ has sufficient mea sures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (through CDP Fin ancial Inc.) is well - positioned to issue green bonds and that CDPQ Green Bond Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018.,Second - Party Opinion CDPQ Green Bond Framework 9 Appendices Appendix 1: Sustainalytics’ Analysis of FSC and PEFC Certifications FSC 10 PEFC 11 Background Founded in 1993 after the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio failed to produce any international agreements to fight against deforestation, FSC aims to promote sustainable forest management practice. PEFC was founded in 1999 in response to the specific requirements of small - and family forest own ers as an international umbrella organization providing independent assessment, endorsement and recognition of national forest certification systems. Basic Principles • Compliance with laws and FSC principles • Tenure and use rights and responsibilities • Indigenous peoples' rights • Community relations and workers' rights • Benefits from the forests • Environmental impact • Management plans • Monitoring and assessment • Special sites – high conservation value forests (HCVF) • Plantations • Maintenance and appropriate enhancement of forest resources and their contribution to the global carbon cycle • Maintenance and enhancement of forest ecosystem health and vitality • Maintenance and encouragement of productive functions of forests (wood and no - wood) • Maintenance, conservation and appropriate enhancement of biological diversity in forest ecosystems • Maintenance and appropriate enhancement of protective functions in forest management (notably soil and water) • Maintenance of socioeconomic functions an d conditions • Compliance with legal requirements Governance The General Assembly, consisting of all FSC members, constitutes the highest decision - making body. At the General Assembly, motions are proposed by one member, seconded by two more, and PEFC’s governance structure is formed by the Gener al Assembly (GA) which is the highest authority and decision - making body. It is made up of all PEFC members, including national and international stakeholders. 10 Forest Stewardship Council , at: https://www.fsc.org/en 11 Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification , at: https://www.pefc.org/,Second - Party Opinion CDPQ Green Bond Framework 10 deliberated and voted on by all members. Members are entitled to vote to amend the bylaws, initiate new policies, and clarify, amend or overturn a policy decision by the board. Members apply to join one of three chambers – environmental, social, or econom ic – that are further divided into northern and southern sub - chambers. Each chamber holds 33.3% of the weight in votes, and within each chamber the votes are weighted so that the North and South hold an equal portion of authority, to ensure influence is s hared equitably between interest groups and countries with different levels of economic development. The votes of all individual members in each sub - chamber represent 10% of the total vote of the sub - chamber, while the votes of organizational members make up the other 90%. The members vote for the board of directors, which is accountable to the members. There is an international board elected by all members and a US board, elected by the US - based members. Members vote on key decisions including endorsements, international standards, new members, st atutes and budgets. All national members have between one and seven votes, depending on membership fees, while international stakeholder members have one vote each. The Board of Directors supports the work of the GA and together the GA and the Board make the formal approval of final draft standards. Standards are developed by working groups. In general, PEFC’s governance structure is more representative of industry and government stakeholders than of social or environmental groups, which gives industry a nd governments more influence in the decision - making process. However, the organization does include stakeholders from all sectors. Scope FSC is a global, multi - stakeholder owned system. All FSC standards and policies are set by a consultative process. T here is an FSC Global standard and for certain countries FSC National standards. Economic, social, and environmental interests have equal weight in the standard setting process. FSC follows the ISEAL Code of Good Practice for Setting Social and Environment al Standards. Multi - stakeholder participation is required in the governance of national schemes as well as in the standard - setting process. Standards and normative documents are reviewed periodically at intervals that do not exceed five years. The PEFC Standard Setting standard is based on ISO/IEC Code for good practice for standardization (Guide 59) 12 and the ISEAL Code of Good Practice for Setting Social and Environmental Standards. Chain - of - Custody • The Chain - of - Custody (CoC) standard is evaluated by a third - party body that is accredited by FSC and compliant with international standards. • CoC standard includes procedures for tracking wood origin. • CoC standard includes specifications for the physical separation of certified and non - certified wood, and fo r the percentage of mixed content (certified and non - certified) of products. • CoC certificates state the geographical location of the producer and the standards against which the process was evaluated. Certificates also state the starting and finishing poin t of the CoC. • Quality or environmental management systems (ISO 9001:2008 or ISO 14001:2004 respectively) may be used to implement the minimum requirements for chain - of - custody management systems required by PEFC. • Only accredited certification bodies can un dertake certification. • CoC requirements include specifications for physical separation of wood and percentage - based methods for products with mixed content. • The CoC standard includes specifications for tracking and collecting and maintaining documentation about the origin of the materials. 12 ISO, “ISO/IEC Guide 59:2019”, (2019), at: https://www.iso.org/standard/23390.html,Second - Party Opinion CDPQ Green Bond Framework 11 • The CoC standard includes specifications for the physical separation of certified and non - certified wood. • The CoC standard includes specifications about procedures for dealing with complains related to participant’s chain of custody. Non - certified wood sources FSC’s Controlled Wood Standard establishes requirements to participants to establish supply - chain control systems, and documentation to avoid sourcing materials from controversial sources, including: a. Illegally harvested wood, including wood that is harvested without legal authorization, from protected areas, without payment of appropriate taxes and fees, using fraudulent papers and mechanisms, in violation of CITES requirements, and others, b. Wood harves ted in violation of traditional and civil rights, c. Wood harvested in forests where high conservation values are threatened by management activities, d. Wood harvested in forests being converted from forests and other wooded ecosystems to plantations or non - for est uses, e. Wood from management units in which genetically modified trees are planted. The PEFC’s Due Diligence System requires participants to establish systems to minimize the risk of sourcing raw materials from: a. forest management activities that do not c omply with local, national or international laws related to: b. operations and harvesting, including land use conversion, o management of areas with designated high environmental and cultural values, o protected and endangered species, including CITES species, o health and labor issues, o indigenous peoples’ property, tenure and use rights, o payment of royalties and taxes. c. genetically modified organisms, d. forest conversion, including conversion of primary forests to forest plantations. Accreditation/ verifi cation FSC - accredited Certification Bodies (CB) conduct an initial assessment, upon successful completion companies are granted a 5 - year certificate. Companies must undergo an annual audit every year and a reassessment audit every 5 years. Certification B odies undergo annual audits from Accreditation Services International (ASI) to ensure conformance with ISO standard requirements. Accreditation is carried out by an accreditation body (AB). Like a certification body checks a company meets the PEFC standard, the accreditation body checks that a certification body meets specific PEFC and ISO requirements. Through the accreditation process PEFC has assurance that certification bodies are independent and impartial, that they follow PEFC certification pr ocedures. PEFC does not have their own accreditation body. Like with the majority of ISO based certifications, PEFC relies on national ABs under the umbrella of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF). National ABs need to be a member of the IAF, whic h means they must follow IAF’s rules and regulations. Conclusion Sustainalytics views both FSC and PEFC as being robust, credible standards that are based on comprehensive principles and criteria that are aligned with ISO. Both schemes have received prais e for their contribution to sustainable forest management practices 13 and both have also faced criticism from civil society actors. 14 , 15 In certain instances, these standards go above and beyond national regulation 13 FESPA, “FSC, PEFC and ISO 38200”, (2018), at: https://www.fespa.com/en/news - media/blog/fsc - pefc - and - iso - 38200 14 Yale Environment 360, “Greenwashed Timber: How Sustainable Fore st Certification Has Failed”, (2018), at: https://e360.yale.edu/features/greenwashed - timber - how - sustainable - forest - certification - has - failed 15 EIA,“PEFC: A Fig Leaf for Stolen Timber”, (2017), at: https://eia - global.org/blog - posts/PEFC - fig - leaf - for - stolen - timber,Second - Party Opinion CDPQ Green Bond Framework 12 and are capable of providing a high level of assurance that sustainable forest management practices are in place. However, in other cases, the standards are equal or similar to national legislation and provide little additional assurance. Ultimately, the level of assurance that can be provided by either scheme is contingent upon several factors including the certification bodies conducting audits, national regulations and local c ontext.,Second - Party Opinion CDPQ Green Bond Framework 13 Appendix 2 : Green Bond / Green Bond Programme - External Review Form Section 1.

Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures , such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an as sessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of,Second - Party Opinion CDPQ Green Bond Framework 18 funds fro m Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a re cognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an establi shed scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion CDPQ Green Bond Framework 19 Disclaimer Copyright ©202 1 Sustainalytics.
