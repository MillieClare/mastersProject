Prologis has engaged Sustainalytics to provide a Second - Part y Opinion on its framework and the framework’s environmental credentials. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with va rious members of Prologis’ management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes an d planned use of proceeds, as well as the management of proceeds and reporting aspects of Prologis’ framework. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. Follow ing this engagement between Prologis and Sustainalytics, some elements of the green bond framework were clarified to ensure an alignment with the level of disclosure expected by ICMA’s Green Bond Principles 2017 2 (GBP 2017) . This document contains two sections: Framew ork Overview – summary o f the Prologis G reen B ond F ramework; and Sustainalytics’ Opinion – an opinion on the framework. Overview of Issuer Prologis, including its family of co - investment ventures and related affiliates , is a leading global logistics real estate company. The compa ny leases distribution facilities to customers in the business - to - business and retail/online fulfilment categories. Prologis was founded in 1983 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Prologis manages its business on an owned - and - managed basis, including properties wholly owned by Prologis, L.P. or owned by their co - investment ventures. The company operates properties on an ownership - blind basis, such that the management policies, including those relating to sustainability, apply to all of the properties the company manages whether held by a co - investment venture or directly by Prologis. Prologis’ sustainability strategy has a strong focus on minimizing the negative environmental impacts of its logistics real estate facilities and corporate of fices , with a core objective of improving energy efficiency and reducing corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Prologis establishes goals, track s progres s and report s outcomes across the company’s portfolio through an ESG framework: • Environmental - imp act of the portfolio and operations; • Social - relationships with employees, customers, investors and communities; and • Governance - organizational policies, procedures and practices. Prologis seek s to do the following, in line with the company’s operatin g and development strategies: • Develop energy - efficient buildings that reduce operating costs ; • Meet recognized sustainable development standards; and • Reduce the company’s environmental footprint. . 2 The Green Bond Principles 2017, dated 2 June 2017, issued by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA),Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Prologis Green Bond 3 Framework Overview Prologis Inc., Prologis, L.P., any of its co - investment ventures or other affiliates may from time to time issue Green Bonds in line with the Prologis “Green Bond Framework.” Prologis issuers of potential and currently outstanding green bonds are set forth in Appendix I. This Framework may also be used to govern other financings for which proceeds are intended to be allocated to Eligible Green Projects that are defined, selected, tracked and reported on in accordance with this Framework. This Green Bond F ramework follows the GBP 2017 which provides guidelines in four key areas: 1. Use of proceeds; 2. Process for project evaluation and selection; 3. Management of proceeds; and 4. Reporting Use of Proceeds The proceeds of the green bond will be allocated towards fin ancing projects that meet the following eligibility criteria. Eligibility Criteria 1. GREEN BUILDINGS : Use of proceeds: New or existing investments in or expenditures on properties which meet at least one of the following requirements: i) New, existi ng or refurbished buildings which have received at least one of the following classifications: a. LEED: Platinum, Gold or Silver b. D GN B : Platinum, Gold, or Silver c. BREEAM: Outstanding , Excellent, Very Good or Good d. HQE: Exceptional, Excellent, Very Good (Very Performant) and Good (Performant) 3 e. CASBEE: S, A or B+ f. DBJ Green Building Certification: 5 or 4 g. BELS: 5 or 4 ii) Refurbishments to properties in order to significantly improve energy efficiency and/or water efficiency of, or make other environmentally beneficial improvements to a building, building subsystem or land, including but not limited to investments in LED and other energy efficient lighting, cool roof and other sustainability - oriented construction materials, smart meters, electr ic and renewable energy charging stations and batteries, xeriscaping/drought - tolerant landscaping, waste diversion, water and energy - saving technologies and materials and improvements recognized by sustainability rating systems. 3 Prologis properties that received HQE status prior to 2015 were ra ted as Performant or Very Performant. HQE has since released a new framework with a rating system of Pass/Good/Very Good/Excellent/Exceptional, and any future Prologis HQE certifications will be under this system. The new framework provides an equivalenc e between the two ratings systems, where Performant matches up with Good and Very Performant with Very Good.,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Prologis Green Bond 4 2. RENEWABLE ENERGY: Us e of Proceeds: New or existing investments in or expenditures on the acquisition, development, construction and/or installation of renewable energy production units. Renewable energy and storage projects can include (but are not limited to): i) Solar panel i nstallations, including those on rooftops of properties owned and/or managed by the Issuer or one of its affiliates ii) Wind - related energy projects 3. ENERGY EFFICIENCY: i) Energy storage systems Project Evaluation and Selection Process Projects to which the Green Bond proceeds are intended to be allocated are evaluated and selected based on compliance with the eligibility criteria set forth under the section “Use of Proceeds” by the Issuer’s Green Bond Committee, which is comprised of members of Prologis ’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) department or persons related to the Issuer or a Prologis affiliate supporting the Prologis ESG department together with members of Prologis management as applicable. Management of Proceeds The Issuer’s Green Bond Committee intends to allocate the proceeds from the issue of Green Bonds to a portfolio of assets (the “Eligible Green Project Portfolio”) within the applicable asset portfolio of the Issuer or any of its affiliates. The Issuer will strive , as long a s the applicable Green Bonds are outstanding , to achieve a level of allocation for the Eligible Green Project Portfolio which, after adjustments for “Intervening Circumstances” ( including, but not limited to, sales, repayments and possible loss of certific ations ) , matches the balance of net proceeds from its outstanding Green Bonds. In the case of Intervening Circumstances, for so long as the applicable Green Bonds are outstanding, the Issuer will strive to add Eligible Green Projects to the Issuer’s Eligib le Green Project Portfolio to the extent required to ensure that the net proceeds from outstanding Green Bonds will be allocated to Eligible Green Projects. The Issuer will internally track the allocated proceeds on a portfolio basis. Pending the allocatio n of the net proceeds of a Green Bond to Eligible Green Projects, all or a portion of the net proceeds may be used for the payment of outstanding indebtedness or other capital management activities . Reporting The Issuer will report on a website for Prolog is, a Prologis affiliate or an Issuer, as applicable, the allocation of net proceeds to the Eligible Green Project Portfolio (the “Allocation Reporting”) within a year of issuance of the applicable Green Bonds . This reporting will be updated annually until full allocation of the Green Bond net proceeds or until the applicable Green Bonds are no longer outstanding. The Issuer intends to report the allocation of the Use of Proceeds to the Eligible Green Project Portfolio at least at the categor y level and on an aggregated basis for all of the Issuer’s Green Bonds for so long as such Green Bonds remain outstanding. To the extent practicable, the Issuer will provide information such as: • The total amount of proceeds allocated; • The number of eligib le projects; • The balance of unallocated proceeds; and,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Prologis Green Bond 5 • For properties in the Eligible Green Project Portfolio: the levels of certification of properties in the portfolio. For so long as the applicable Green Bonds are outstanding, to the extent the Eligible Green Portfolio has changed in the Allocation Reporting from the prior year’s Allocation Reporting, if and as disclosed by the Issuer in applicable Green Bond documentation, the Issuer intends to receive a report from an independent accountant or a Green Bond Committee report attesting to its examination of the Issuer’s management’s assertion of the allocation of the Green Bond net proceeds to the Eligible Green Project Portfolio.,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Prologis Green Bond 6 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sus tainalytics’ Opinion on the Prologis Green Bond Framework Summary Overall, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Prologis Green Bond Framework is credible , robust and aligns with four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2017. In addition, Sustainalytics views the following elem ents of the Prologis Green Bond Framework positively: • Green Buildings, Renewable Energy , and Energy Efficiency are recognized by the Green Bond Principles as project categories with clear environmental benefits, and Sustainalytics views the projects set forth in the use of proceeds of the Prologis Green Bond Framework as having a positive impact (for additional in formation on impact see Section 3) • The eligibility criterion of Prologis’ certified buildings is based on third - party certification standards, specifically LEED, D GN B, BREEAM, HQE, CASBEE , DBJ Green Building Certification , and BELS . Sustainalytics has cond ucted an evaluation of the certifications, and views the properties meeting such certification standards as having a positive impact (see Appendix III for additional details on the certification schemes). • Sustainalytics recognizes that the top two levels within the certification schemes above are generally preferred by some investors as a benchmark for green bond eligibility, as they provide a higher level of assurance of positive impact. Nonetheless, given the nature of Prologis’ building portfolio (which includes large, potentially energy - intensive buildings), Sustainalytics is of the view that the inclusion in Prologis’ Green Bond Framework of green buildings that achieve certification levels ranging from good to excellent performance will have a clear positive environmental impact . • Prologis has a Green Bond Committee in place that is comprised of members of the company’s management as well as members of the company’s ESG department , or persons related to the Issuer or a Prologis affiliate supporting the company’s ESG department , as applicable. The committee evaluates and selects projects funded by bond proceeds based on the defined eligibility criteria. This is in line with market practice. • Prologis’ disclosure and processes with respect to the manag ement of proceeds are in line with market practice. • The company has committed to reporting on an annual basis, yearly allocation amounts to the “Eligible Green Project Portfolio” at a portfolio level. This will include total amounts allocated, number of e ligible projects, and the balance of unallocated proceeds This is in line with market practice . T hrough extensive discussions with Prologis’ sustainability team, it has become clear that sustainable building practices at Prologis are integrated and owned a t the field level across a substantial portfolio across 19 countries and various restraints on tenant data collection exist . Sustainalytics acknowledges that obtaining environmental impact data from leased properties is reasonably limited by the size, global scale and structure of the company . G iven this context the commitment to report on the certification levels of green buildings is in Sustainalytics view, acceptable. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 2017: Sustainalytics has determined that t he Prologis Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2017. For detailed inform ation please refer to Appendix IV : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form.,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Prologis Green Bond 7 Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of the Issuer Contr ibution of the proceeds of the green bonds to Prologis’ sustainability strategy Prologis has embedded sustainability into its global business strategy and pursues ambitious targets that further advance its sustainability objectives. Some notable aspects of the company’s sustainability strategy include: • The company’s approach to sustainability is holistic and a clear commitment from senior executives to advance the company’s sustainability goals i s evident. • Prologis produces an annual sustainability report in accordance with the GRI Standards - Core option, further demonstrating the company’s commitment to transparency and sustainability. In addition, the company’s 2016 report was assured by an in dependent auditor, which in Sustainalytics view demonstrates leading practice. • Prologis has reported its GHG inventory to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) on an annual basis since 2006 and is a signatory to the CDP’s Commit to Action. In Sustainalytics view, this demonstrates a clear commitment to reduce the company’s impacts on climate change. In addition, the company states that it aims to align its business practices with the advancement of three UN Sustainable Development Goals: Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation and Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. • The company has established a comprehensive set of strategic environmental and energy targets. For example, the company aims to increase its overall solar generating capacity to 200 MW by 2020 and , in 2016 , Prologis reported that it ha d installed 165 MW and was on track to achieve this goal. • Prologis demonstrates an ongoing commitment to the sustainability of its logistics facilities by obtaining sustainable buildings certification for 233 projects across 16 countries as of year - end 2016, with the goal of ob taining certification for 100% of new developments (where appropriate and rating systems are available) going forward. • Prologis’ environmental stewardship policies extend to its suppliers, which is outlined in its Supplier Code of Conduct. 4 Sustainalytics views this as evidence of Prologis’ commitment to sustainability across its value chain. Overall, Sustainalytics considers Prologis to be well positioned to issue green bonds given its leading sustainability practices and commitments. Furthermore, the iss uance of green bonds aligns with the company’s sustainability strategy and will contribute to the realization of its environmental and energy targets. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects As a glob al real estate company, Prologis is exposed to certain environmental and social risks such as worker health and safety and environmental degradation and water pollution risk surrounding its facilities. To mitigate these risks, Prologis has a comprehensive risk management framework in place that proactively manages risk through weekly investment committee meetings and a centralized team that is dedicated to managing risk globally and is closely engaged with Prologis’ teams at the individual market level. Th e company also ensures that rigorous internal and third - party audits are performed that assess the company’s controls and procedures. 5 Furthermore, the company certifies real estate projects under globally recognized green buildin g certifications (see Appendix III for comparison table). For example, the company’s HQE - and BREEAM - certified projects increase the scope of this assessment as they require: - An impact assessment on local populations ( neighborhood ) 4 Prologis Supplier Code of Conduct https://www.prologis.com/docs/Prologis%20Supplier%20Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf 5 Prologis Sustainability Report https://prologis.getbynder.com/m/0a6fa29618a465f4/original/Prologis_2016_SustainabilityReport. pdf,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Prologis Green Bond 8 - An impact assessment on noise and visual negat ive impacts; - Air, water and electromagnetic quality studies; - Waste management practices and use of local materials; - Biodiversity protection. It should also be noted that Prologis rates as one of the outperforming companies in the Real Estate industry in te rms of ESG performance, according to Sustainalytics’ ESG research. 6 Given the company’s strong ESG performance, comprehensive risk mitigation framework, and commitment to ensure 100% of new developments achieve recognized green building certifications, Su stainalytics is of the opinion that the company is well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with its real estate developments . 6 Information as of September 2017; For further details please refer to Appendix II,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Prologis Green Bond 9 Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds Impact of green building certifications for logistics buildings The commercial and residential re al estate sector continues to have a sizeable environmental footprint due to considerable GHG emissions and as a result has emerged as a significant contributor to climate change globally . In 2015, the direct GHG emissions from the US commercial and residential real estate sector accounted for approximately 12% of total emissions. 7 In Europe a similar situation exists . I n France , for example , the real estate sector accounts for 43% of fina l energy consumption 8 and 25% of GHG emissions. Additionally, in Japan, CO2 emissions generated by the commercial and residential real estate sector account for over 30% of total emissions 9 . In light of this substantial footprint , it is Sustainalytics’ view that the allocat i on of green bond proceeds towards buildings that have achieved LEED, BREEAM, HQE, DGNB, CASBEE , DBJ Green Building Certification , and BELS certification s will achieve positive environmental impact . It will reduc e energy, materials and water use and increas e the overall sustainability of the company’s logistics buildings , thereby reduc ing the negative impacts of the commercial real estate sector on climate change . Overall Sustainalytics considers these certification schemes to be credib le schemes that ensure an integration of social and environmental considerations during all stages of a building’s life cycle. Appendix II I shows a comparison between these certification schemes . Sustainalytics recognizes that the top two levels within the certification schemes above are generally preferred by some investors as a benchmark for green bond eligibility, as they provide a higher level of assurance of positive impact. Nonetheless, give n the nature of Prologis’ building portfolio (which includes large, potentially energy - intensive buildings), Sustainalytics is of the view that the inclusion in Prologis’ Green Bond Framework of green buildings that achieve certification levels ranging fro m good to excellent performance will have a clear positive environmental impact. Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the ye ar 2030. This green bond advances the following SDG goals and targets: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Green Buildings 9.

Proceeds of the bonds will be used to finance or refinance projects intended to improve the environmental performance of the company’s property holdings. Specifically, proceeds will be allocated to projects relating to: ( i) Green B uildings; (ii) Renewable Energy; and (iii) Energy Efficiency, all categories recognized by the Green Bond Principles as having positive enviro nmental impacts. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the use of third - party green building certification schemes ensures the integration of environmental and social considerations and that the good - to - excellent levels of green buildings certification to be achieved by eligible Prologis buildings will result in clear positive environmental impacts. In addition, Prologis Green Bond Framework fully aligns with the company’s sustainability strategy and will support Prologis in achieving several environmental and energy reduction goals and help advance two SDGs . Regarding impact reporting, Sustainalytics acknowledges that obtaining environmental impact data from leased properties is reasonably limited by the size, global scale and structure of the company . G ive n this context , Prologis’ commitment to report on the certification levels of green buil dings is , in Sustainalytics view, acceptable . Overall , Sus tainalytics is confident that Prologis is well positioned to issue a Green Bond and that Prologis’ Green Bond Framework is transparent, credible, and in alignment with the four core components of ICMA’s Green Bond Principles 2017.,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Prologis Green Bond 11 A ppendices Appendix I : List of Current or Potential Prologis Issuers • Prologis European Logistics Fund, FCP - FIS (Guarantor) and • Prologis International Funding II SA (Issuer and subsidiary of Prologis European Logistics Fund, FCP - FIS) • Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc.,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Prologis Green Bond 12 Appendix II : Sustainalytics’ ESG Assessment of Prologis,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Prologis Green Bond 13 Appendix II I : Overview and C omparison of Real Estate Certification Schemes LEED 10 BREEAM 11 HQE 12 DGNB 13 CASBEE 14 DBJ Green Building Certification 15 16 BELS 17 Backgroun d Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a US Certification System for residential and commercial buildings used worldwide. LEED was developed by the non - profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and covers the design, construction, maintenance and opera tion of buildings. BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) was first published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in 1990. Based in the UK. Used for new, refurbished and extension of existing buildings. The Haut e Qualité Environnemen tale or HQE (High Quality Environmental standard) is a standard for green building in France, based on the principles of sustainable development first set out at the 1992 Earth Summit. The standard was launched in 2005 and is controll ed by HQE and certificate is issued by Cerway/ Certivea/ Cerqual. The German Green Building Certification or DGNB was developed in 2007 by the non - profit German Sustainable Building Council in partnership with the German Federal Ministry of Transport, Buil ding, and Urban Affairs in order to actively encourage sustainable building. CASBEE (Comprehensi ve Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency) represents a green building management system from Japan, evaluating and rating the environmental perfor mance of buildings and the built environment. CASBEE is formed of four assessment tools tailored to different scales: housing, building, district and city. DBJ Green Building Certification Programme was launched by Development Bank of Japan in 2011 and is operated together with Japan Real Estate Institute (JREI). The programme is recognized as one of regional standards. The certification is available for office buildings, logistics, residential & retail facilities. BELS (Building - Housing Energy - efficiency Labelling System) , which is the third - party verification, assesses and labels energy conservation performance s of non - residential buildings and houses. BELS was established by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism , based on Article 7 of the Act on the Improvement of Energy Consumption Performance of Buildings.

Used in more than 70 countries: Good adaptation to the local normative context. Predominant environmental focus. BREEAM certification is less strict (less minimum th resholds) than HQE and LEED certifications. HQE certification has the most number of targets concerning individuals. The “Comfort” and “Health” related themes are the most developed in this scheme. The HQE scheme recognises European and international standards (in particular the ISO and ASHRAE standards). DGNB certification is based on current European Union standards and norms and is being recommended by the German Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development. DGNB System has partners hips in a number of countries, among which Bulgaria, Denmark, Austria, Thailand and Switzerland. In Japan, many local governments have made CASBEE assessment results mandatory for building permits. Compared to similar tools available internationally , CASBE E displays a unique and simple structure. In addition to LEED and CASBEE, DBJ Green Buildings Certification Programme is considered as one of the green building standards in Japan. 27 According to its website, as of Feb 2018, 499 properties in Japan are cer tifed by the programme. BELS is widely used in Japan and recognized by the Japanese as a third party certification system based on Guidelines for Labelling Building Energy Efficiency Performance , which was introduced in 2016 as part of Article 7. 27 Japan sharpens its green building focus, Read Views; https://www.jllrealviews.com/places/japan - sharpens - its - green - building - focus/,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Prologis Green Bond 17 Appendix IV : Green Bond / Green Bond Programme - External Review Form Section 1.

In the case of Intervening Circumstances, for so long as the applicable Green Bonds are outstanding, the Issuer will strive to add Eligible Green Projects to the Issuer’s Eligible Green Project Portfolio to the extent required to ensure that the net proceeds from outstanding Green Bonds will be allocated to Eligible Green Projects.

Consultant Review: An issuer can seek advice from consultants and/or institutions with recognized expertise in environmental sustainability or other aspects of the issuance of a Green Bond, such as the establishment/review of an issuer’s Green Bond framework. “ Second Party Opinion s” may fall into this category. ii. Verification: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework, or underlying assets independently verified by qualified parties, such as auditors. In contrast to certi fication, verification may focus on alignment with internal standards or claims made by the issuer. Evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against an external green assessment standard. An assessment standard defines criteria, and alignment with such criteria is tested by qualified third parties / certifiers. iv. Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework rated by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies. Green Bond ratings are separate from an issuer’s ESG rating as they typically apply to individual securities or Green Bond frameworks / programmes.,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Prologis Green Bond 24 Disclaimer © Sustainalytics 2018.
