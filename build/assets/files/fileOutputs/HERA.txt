C O M / E S G 3 o f 3 1 Overall Evaluation of the Green Financing Framework Hera commissioned ISS - oekom to assist with its Green Financing Programme by assessing th ree core elements to determine the sustainability quality of the Framework : 1. Hera ’s G reen F inancing F ramework – benchmarked against the International Capital Market Association's ( ICMA ) Green Bon d Principles (GBP s ). 2. The asset pool – whether the projects aligned with ISS - oekom’s issue - specific key performance indicators (KPIs) (See Annex 2 ). 3. Hera ’s sustainability performance, according to the ISS - oekom C orporate R ating.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Gre e n B ond As s e t P ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 4 o f 3 1 ISS - oekom ASSESSMENT SUMMARY SPO SECTION SUMMARY EVALUATION1 Part 1: Performance against the GBPs The issuer has defined a formal concept for its Framework regarding use of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the ICMA GBPs. Positive Part 2: Sustainability quality of the asset pool The overall sustainability quality of the asset pool in terms of sustainability benefits, risk avoidance and minimisation is good based upon the ISS-oekom Green Bond KPIs. The KPIs contain a clear description of eligible asset categories which include water infrastructure, energy efficiency and energy infrastructure and circular economy and sustainable waste management. All project categories contribute, in a significant or limited way, to the Sustainable Development Goals. All assets of the asset pool are located in Italy, where legislative frameworks set minimum standards, which reduce environmental and social risks. Positive Part 3: Issuer sustainability performance Within the methodology of the ISS-oekom Corporate Rating, the issuer shows a good sustainability performance and with a ranking of 6th out of 43 sector peers, is classified as “ Prime ” in the ISS-oekom methodology. Hera is a multi-utility company and such generates its revenue from water, waste management, electricity generation and distribution, gas distribution and other services. With the purification of water alongside the provision of clean drinking water and sanitary services, the company responds to the global sustainability challenge of providing access to water. Yet, these activities do not account for the major share of net sales. In addition, Hera’s electricity and heat generation is almost 50% based on natural gas, while the majority share is based on renewable or waste to energy sources. Across all the key ESG challenges faced by the Multi Utility sector, Hera demonstrates above average performance. Furthermore, Hera has taken sound measures to reduce environmental impacts of waste incineration plants and has taken adequate measures to ensure pipeline integrity and safety in the scope of its gas distribution activity. Hera implemented good corporate governance practices and business ethics rules. It is rated 6th out of 43 companies within its sector as of 17.06.2019.

C O M / E S G 7 o f 3 1 ISS - oekom SPO ASSESSMENT PART I: GREEN BOND PRINCIPLES 1. Use of Proceeds An amount equal to the net proceeds from the issuance of Green Financings will be used exclusively to finance and/or refinance, in whole or in part, new and existing Eligible Green Projects, carried out directly and/or indirectly through Hera’s subsidiaries. Hera considers as Eligible Green Project those that comply w ith the Eligibility Criteria (in coherence with the Group shared value framework) as defined below: ELIGIBLE CATEGORY DESCRIPTION OF ELIGIBLE GREEN PROJECTS ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES Energy Efficiency and Energy Infrastructure • Improvement of Private and Public buildings lighting, heating, insulation • Smart grids for distributed generation and for climate change adaptation • Smart metering • District heating grids • Public Lighting & Smart Cities • Charging Stations • High Efficiency Cogeneration & Combined product of heat and power • Increase of energy production by non-fossil fuels • Contribute to climate change mitigation Circular Economy & Sustainable Waste Management • Urban Waste Collection Systems: Community recycling depot, Dumpsters and containers for sorted waste collection, Pay as You Throw projects, Vehicles for urban waste collection • Facilities & Plants for recycling of materials including Plastic, Glass, and Raw Materials recycling and recovery and/or further re-use into production process and Waste Selection improvements • Waste to energy plants • Biological and Chemical Treatment and other waste treatment plants • Increase of sorted waste collection and disposal and reduction of waste disposed in landfills • Contribute to climate change mitigation Water infrastructure Types of projects: Wastewater, Sewage, and Water infrastructure for resources resilience and climate change adaption • Improvement of wastewater treatment plants • Contribute to climate change mitigation Eligible Green Projects may include new, on - going or existing projects funded no more than two calendar years before the issuance of each Green Financing instrument.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Gre e n B ond As s e t P ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 8 o f 3 1 Eligible Green Projects may include capital expenditures, operating expenditures related t o improvement and maintenance of Eligible Green Projects, research and development expenses, as well as equity shares of companies specialized 2 in any of the above Eligible Categories. Opinion: ISS - oekom considers the Use of Proceeds description provided by Hera ’s Green Financing Framework as aligned with the GBPs . The e nvironmental benefits are described and quantified , demonstrating the positive impact of each U se o f P roceeds category . 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection Hera has an internal procedure for the management of a Green bond process and the related projects. Such procedure entails also the involvement of the Ethics and Sustainability Committee. The Ethics and Sustainability Committee is composed of four members, two independent Director s of Hera Spa (the Committee Chairman and a member), and two experts with regard to Corporate Social Responsibility and Italian Legislative Decree No. 231/01 (the Shared value and Sustainabilit y Director and an external member). More in detail the annual reporting of investments will be examined by the Ethics and Sustainability Committee , since investments and KPI are included in the Sustainability Report, prior to Board of Directors approval. Opinion: ISS - oekom finds that the process for Project Evaluation and Selection broadly aligns with the GBPs. F urther information about how the Ethics and S ustainability Committee reviews, selects and validates pool of project s would strengthen alignment with the GBPs . 3. Management of Proceeds The net proceeds from each Hera’s Green Financing instrument will be deposited in Hera’s general account and an amount equal to the net proceeds will be earmarked for allocation to the Eligible Green Projects as selected according the internal procedure. Each Eligible Green Project can be allocated to one or several Green Financing instruments. Allocation to Eligible Green Projects will be monitored and accounted for in Hera’s internal tracking system, to ensure that each expense is not funded by more than one Green Financing instrument, and to avoid double counting. At the end of each calendar year and so long as the instruments a re outstanding, the balance of the net proceeds of the issuance not already allocated to (re)finance Eligible Green Projects will be reduced by amounts matching disbursements made during the calendar year to Eligible Green Projects. Hera will use its best efforts to substitute any Green Projects i n the case of divestment or if no longer eligible, as soon as practical once an appropriate substitution option has been identified. 2 A company will be considered eligible if it derives 90% or more of its revenues from activities falling in any of the above E ligible Categories.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Gre e n B ond As s e t P ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 9 o f 3 1 Unallocated Proceeds Pending the allocation or reallocation, as the case may b e, of the net proceeds to Eligible Green Projects, Hera will invest the balance of the net proceeds, at its own discretion, in cash or other liquid marketable instruments in its liquidity portfolio. Opinion: ISS - oekom finds that the segregation, tracking o f funds and process for unallocated funds aligns with the GBPs. The process to avoid double counting is also positive . U nallocated proceeds that are invested in cash or other liquid instruments have no time limit for this temporary allocation . 4. Reporting Hera will report on the allocation of net proceeds and associated environmental benefits annually until the proceeds of each Green Finance instrument issued has been fully allocated, and as necessary in the event of material development or in case of subst itution of Green Projects. This report will be published in the Group Sustainability report and will be made available on the Group website www.gruppohera.it . A. Allocation Repo rting • The aggregated amount of Green Financing instruments issued by type (i.e. Green Bond, Green Loan ) • For each Green Financing: o The aggregated amount of allocation of the net proceeds to the Eligible Green Projects (at category level), with a description and s elected case studies; o The balance of any unallocated proceeds invested in cash or other liquid marketable instruments ; and, o The proportion of net proceeds used for financing versus refinancing,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Gre e n B ond As s e t P ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 0 o f 3 1 B. Impact reporting Hera will report on a number of environmental impact metrics associated with the Eligible Green P rojects funded with the net proceeds of each Green Financing. Examples of KPIs (reported in comparison with ante investment situation or previous year) , that will depend on the eligible project financed, are illustrated bellow. ELIGIBLE CATEGORY EXAMPLE OF KPIS FOR REPORTING WHERE APP LICABLE Energy Efficiency and energy infrastructure ▪ Energy saved (toe) ▪ GHG emission avoided (tCO2e) ▪ Network length (km) ▪ Number of event of interruption by client (n) ▪ Installed Smart meters (n) ▪ Served Citizens/Points of grid distribution (POD, PDR) ▪ Public lighting points with Led technology Circular economy & Sustainable Waste Management ▪ Recycled plastic sold (ton) ▪ GHG emission avoided (tCO2e) ▪ Atmospheric emissions reduction with respect to legal limits (%) ▪ Heat energy, biomethane and electricity produced from waste treatment (MWh) ▪ Treated waste (ton) ▪ Separated/Sorted collection of waste (%) ▪ Waste sent for the recovery of material (%) Water infrastructure ▪ Served citizens (n) ▪ Network length (km) ▪ Water fed in the network by source (mc) ▪ Water distributed using tanker trucks (mc) ▪ Quality of the waste-water in compliance with regulatory limits (%) ▪ Urban areas compliant with law regarding waste-water treatment (%) Opinion: ISS - oekom finds that the reporting is fully aligned to the requirements of the GBPs. This includes publishing on a regular basis and the type of content that will be reported. External review 1.

C O M / E S G 3 0 o f 3 1 ANNEX 2 : Methodology ISS - oekom Green Bond KPIs The ISS - oekom Green Bond KPIs serves as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality – i.e. the social and environmental added value – of the use of proceeds of Hera ’s Green Bond. It comprises firstly the definition of the use of proceeds categor y offering added social and/or environmental value, and secondly the specific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the assets can be clearly identified and described. The sustainability criteria are complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measurement of the sustainability performance of the assets and which can also be used for reporting. To review the KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Federico Pezzolato (detai ls above) who will send them directly to you. Asset evaluation methodology ISS - oekom evaluates whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eligible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bond KPIs . All percentages refer to the amoun t of assets within one category (e.g. wind power). Additionally, the assessment “no or limited information is available” either indicates that no information was made available to ISS - oekom or that the information provided did not fulfil the requirements o f the ISS - oekom Green Bond KPIs . The evaluation was carried out using information and documents provided to ISS - oekom on a confidential basis by Hera (e.g. Due Diligence Reports). Further, national legislation and standards, depending on the asset location, were drawn on to complement the information provided by the issuer. Assessment of the contribution and association to the SDG The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed in September 2015 by the United Nations and provide a benchmark for key opportunities and challenges toward a more sustainable future . Using a proprietary method, ISS - oekom identifies the extent to which Hera ’s Green Bond contributes to related SDGs and has a positive association with their respective sub - targets . The c ontribution assessment i s split into two Levels: 1. Level 1: Contribution and/or obstruction of the Use of Proceeds cat egories to be financed through the bond to the UN SDGs 2. Level 2: Association of the assets’ ESG performance with further SDGs,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Gre e n B ond As s e t P ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 3 1 o f 3 1 About ISS - oekom SPO ISS - oekom is one of the world’s leading rating agencies in the field of sustainable investment. The agency analyses companies and countries regarding their environmental and social performance. As part of our Sustainable ( Green & Social ) Bond Services, we provide support for companies and institutions issuing sustainable bonds, advise them on the selection of categories of projects to be financed and help them to define ambitious criteria. We assess alignment with external principles (e.g. the ICMA Green / Social Bond Pri nciples), analyse the sustainability quality of the assets and review the sustainability performance of the issuer themselves. Following these three steps, we draw up an independent SPO so that investors are as well informed as possible about the quality o f the bond / loan from a sustainability perspective .
