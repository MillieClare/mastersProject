‘ Second Opinion ’ on Agder Energi ’ s Green Bond Framework 20 October 2017,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Agder Energi’s Gre en Bond Framework 2 Summary Overall, Agder Energi’s Green Bond Framework, together with its e nvironmental s trategy for hydropower project management and climate gas emission reporting as part of the social responsibility reporting, provide a sound base for climate friendly investments. Agder Energi’s Green Bond Framework is in line with the recommendations of the Green Bond Principles. The framework lists eligible projects that support the objective to promote the transition to low carbon, climate resilient growth and a sustainable economy. The company has clear guidelines for the management of the green bond proceeds. Agder Energi will report on various indicators of projects financed by the green bond proceeds. These reports will be available to both investors and the public. The framework promotes two types of climate mitigation measures in the form of renewable energ y and energy efficiency projects. Renewable energy projects will encompass investments in new and existing hydropower and potentially onshore windpower plants. Local environmental impacts are considered in the Environmental Management Program, however GHG emissions during the construction phase could be a cause for concern. Ene r gy efficiency investments will focus on different types of enhancements to the tran s m i ssion and distribution grid. These investments aim to improve the resilience and flexibility of the grid . Given Norway’s largely renewable - based electricity mix , investments in transmission - and distribution grids are unlikely to lock - in or incentivize the use of fossil fuels. The framework excludes direct investments in fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation projects . Agder Energi, as well as one of its sub - companies, is certified as “Miljøfyrtårn”, a Norwegian environmental certification scheme. Base d on the assessment of the project types that will be financed by the green bond, and the assessment of policies and reporting standards, Agder Energi’s Green Bond Framework receives a Dark Green shading.,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Agder Energi’s Green Bond Framework 3 Contents Summary ________________________________ ________________________________ ______________________ 2 1 Introduction and background ________________________________ ________________________________ 4 Expressing concerns with ‘shades of green’ ................................ ................................ ................................ .................. 4 2 Brief Description of Agder Energi’s Green Bond Framework and rules and procedures for climate - related activities ________________________________ ________________________________ _________________ 6 Definition: ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 6 Selection: ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 6 Management of proceeds: ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ...... 6 Transparency and Accountability: ................................ ................................ ................................ ........................... 7 3 Assessment of Agder Energi Green Bond Framework and environmental policies __________________ 10 Eligible projects under the Green Bond Framework ................................ ................................ .............................. 10 Strengths ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 11 Weaknesses ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................... 12 Pitfalls ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ... 12 Impacts beyond the project boundary ................................ ................................ ................................ ............ 12 Appendix: About CICERO ________________________________ ________________________________ ________ 13,C ICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Agder Energi’s Green Bond Framework 4 1 I ntroduction and background As an independent, not - for - profit, research institute, CICERO (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research - Oslo) provides Second Opinions on institutions’ framework and guidance for assessing and selecting eligible projects for green bond investments, and assesses the framework’s r obustness in meeting the institutions’ environmental objectives. The Second Opinion is based on documentation of rules and frameworks provided by the institutions themselves (the client) and information gathered during meetings, teleconferences and e - mail correspondence with the client. CICERO is independent of the entity issuing the bond, its directors, senior management and advisers, and is remunerated in a way that prevents any conflicts of interests arising as a result of the fee structure. CICERO has e stablished the global Expert Network on Second Opinions (ENSO), a network of independent non - profit research institutions on climate change and other environmental issues, to broaden the technical expertise and regional experience for Second Opinions. CICE RO works confidentially with other members in the network to enhance the links to climate and environmental science, building upon the CICERO model for Second Opinions. In addition to CICERO, ENSO members currently include Basque Center for Climate Change (BC3), International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), and Tsinghua University's Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy. A more detailed description of CICERO can be found at the end of this report. ENSO encourages the client to make this Second Opinion publically available. If any part of the Second Opinion is quoted, the full report must be made available. CICERO’s Second Opinions are normally restricted to an evaluation of the mechanisms or framew ork for selecting eligible projects at a general level. CICERO does not validate or certify the climate effects of single projects, and thus, has no conflict of interest in regard to single projects. CICERO is neither responsible for how the framework or m echanisms are implemented and followed up by the institutions, nor the outcome of investments in eligible projects. This note provides a Second Opinion of A gder Energi Green Bonds Framework and policies for considering the environmental impacts of their pr ojects. The aim is to assess the A gder Energy Green Bonds Framework as to its ability to support A gder Energi `s stated objective of promoting the transition to low - carbon and climate resilient growth. This Second Opinion is based on the green bond framework presented to CICERO by the issuer. Any amendments or updates to the framework require that CICERO undertake a new assessment. CICERO takes a long - term view on activities that support a low - carbon climate resilient society. In some cases, activiti es or technologies that reduce near - term emissions result in net emissions or prolonged use of high - emitting infrastructure in the long - run. CICERO strives to avoid locking - in of emissions through careful infrastructure investments, and moving towards low - or zero - emitting infrastructure in the long run. Proceeds from green bonds may be used for financing, including refinancing, new or existing green projects as defined under the mechanisms or framework. CICERO assesses in this Second Opinion the likeliness that the issuer's categories of projects will meet expectations for a low carbon and climate resilient future. Expressing concerns with ‘shades of green’ CICERO Second Opinions are graded dark green, medium green or light green, reflecting the climate and environmental ambitions of the bonds and the robustness of the governance structure of the Green Bond,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Agder Energi’s Gre en Bond Framework 5 Framework. The grading is based on a broad qualitative assessment of each project type, according to what extent it contributes to building a low - carbon and climate resilient society. This Second Opinion will allocate a ‘shade of green’ to the green bond framework of A gder Energi :  Dark green for projects and solutions that are realizations today of the long - term vision of a low carbon and climate resilient future. Typically, this will entail zero emission solutions and governance structures that integrate environmental concerns into all activities.  Medium green for projects and solutions that represent steps towards the long - term vision, but are not quite t here yet.  Light green for projects and solutions that are environmentally friendly but do not by themselves represent or is part of the long - term vision (e.g. energy efficiency in fossil - based processes).  Brown for projects that are irrelevant or in opposi tion to the long - term vision of a low carbon and climate resilient future. The project types that will be financed by the green bond primarily define the overall grading. However, governance and transparency considerations also factor in, as they can give an indication whether the institution that issues the green bond will be able to fulfil the climate and environmental ambitions of the investment framework.,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Agder Energi’s Gre en Bond Framework 6 2 Brief Description of A gder Energi ’s Green Bond Framework and rules and procedures for climate - related activities Agder Energi is a regional electricity company located in the South of Norway. The company provides services in its home region as well as across the rest of Norway. Agder Energi’s activities fall into three categories: Electric ity generation and sale from its hydropower plants, providing district heating, distribution grid services and other related grid services . The different activities are organized as sub - companies within the Agder Energi group. V arious regional municipaliti es have a cumulative 54.5 % ownership stake in Agder Energi. The remaining shares are held by the largest Norwegian state owned electricity company, Statkraft AS. The company reported an annual profit of 251 million NOK (32 mill. USD) in 2016. Agder Energi has an average annual electricity production of 8.1 TWh, which makes it the third largest electricity producer in Norway. According to the company website, Agder Energi ’s 49 wholly and partly owned hydropower plants contribute 99 % of the company’s total energy production , which is a combination of electricity and heat production. The district heating activities are based on a variety of fuels, such as bio - waste from forestry, industrial waste - heat, bio - oil and biogas , as well as, to a smaller extent, foss il oil and gas. Agder Energi strive s to operate using only renewable energy sources and has over the past years reduced the use of fossil fuel oil. Agder Energi has policies and systems for managing a.o. health, security and environmental risk s . The compa ny reports its climate gas emissions. All policies for risk assessment and management, as well as reporting standards for climate gasses are applied to all major sub - companies in which Agder Energi has a controlling stake. Definition: Eligible project s ar e within the field of climate mitigation. Eligible technologies are renewable energy and energy efficiency. Eligible projects may be funded in whole or in part by Agder Energi or its subsidiaries . Projects will be located in Norway. The framework states th at green bond proceeds will not be used to finance nuclear or fossil energy generation projects. The green bond proceeds may be used to purchase or develop new eligible projects as well as to renovate, upgrade and refinance existing eligible projects. All eligible projects are going to be included in the “Green Project Portfolio” . Projects will be excluded from this portfolio if they for whatever reason seize to fulfill the criteria. Selection: Projects fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be evaluate d, selected and approved by the Treasury Department in cooperation with the relevant business unit at Agder Energi. An environmental specialist will be p art of this decision making process . All decisions are taken in consensus, lending the environmental expert veto powers. Proceeds from the green bond can only be used for projects fulfilling the eligibility criteria and Agder Energi’s Group Stra tegy for Social Responsibility. Management of proceeds: The framework states that a n amount of equal size to th e green bond proceeds will be credited to a special account for the funding of eligible projects. According to the framework , actual payments to eligible projects will be made,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Agder Energi’s Gre en Bond Framework 7 from other funds and accounts in the company. At the end of every financial quar ter, all payments to eligible projects will be reimbursed using the green bond proceeds on the special account. This will continue for as long as the balance on the special account is positive and for as long as the bond is outstanding. The special account balance will be placed in liquidity reserves until disbursement to eligible projects. While in the liquidity reserve, the proceeds will be managed along with other funds in the reserve. The policies guiding the management of the reserve restrict investmen t and allocation to bank deposits, commercial paper and bonds issued by banks and municipalities, the issuer informed upon request. Transparency and Accountability: Investors in the green bond will receive an annual investor letter containing information on : P rojects that have been financed, project characteristics, the allocated amounts and expected environmental impacts. The letter will also outline the share of proceeds that has been used for new investments and refinancing. According to the framework , the issuer aims to report on impacts using the following metrics: For renewable energy : E xpected and actual amount of capacity added, restored, connected and distributed. For energy efficiency projects : T he issuer aims to report on the expected and achie ved energy efficiency gains. Upon request the issuer informed that in cases where an eligible project has been financed only in part by green bond proceeds, the investor letter will point out the specific share of renewable energy or energy efficiency improvements financed by the green bond proceeds. The same logic applies to joint ven ture projects where Agder Energi stands for only a share of the financing. The investor letter will be publicly available on the issuer’s website. The internal tracking of proceeds, the allocation of proceeds and the investor letter will be verified by th e issuer’s own internal compliance function. The opinion of this compliance function will also be made publicly available on the issuer’s website. The framework also states that the second opinion and the framework itself will be publicly available on the issuer’s website.

The framework and procedures for A gder Energi ’s green bond investments are assessed and their strengths and weaknesses are discussed in this section. The strengths of an in vestment framework with respect to environmental impact are areas where it clearly supports low - carbon projects, whereas the weaknesses are typically areas that are unclear or too general. Pitfalls are also raised in this section to note areas where issuer s should be aware of potential macro - level impacts of investment projects. Eligible projects under the Green Bond Framework At the basic level, the selection of eligible project categories is the primary mechanism to ensure that projects deliver environmen tal benefits. Through selection of project categories with clear environmental benefits, green bonds aim to provide certainty to investors that their investments deliver environmental returns as well as financial returns. The Green Bonds Principles (GBP) s tate that the “overall environmental profile” of a project should be assessed and that the selection process should be “well defined”.

Interconnectors to other countries are not included . Table 2. Eligible project categories Strengths Overall, we find Agder Energi’s Green Bond Framework to be in compliance with the 2017 Green Bond Principles. Health, security and environment risk assessment established across all operations Th e analysis and management of risk is part of business plans that have been established for all the company’s activities. Health, security and environment (HSE) is one of four key elements in the company’s risk analysis , according to the annual report. Due to varying types of activities, the risk analysis work is done on the operations level and reported to Agder Energi’s managing board. HSE is treated as a priority topic in all leadership groups. Focus on environmental concerns in larger hydropower project s The environmental risk analysis on a project level in the hydropower sector is conducted in the form of the “Environmental management program” (Miljøoppfølgingsprogrammet – MOP). Under MOP , environmental concerns, regulations and mitigating measures are described for single, typically larger hydropower projects. The program defines concrete environmental goals for each topical segment of the project. The aim is to minimize environmental impacts, both in terms of physical changes to the landscape and in terms of emissions into the air, soil, and water. The MOP is supposed to maintain the f ocus on environmental impacts and the ir mitigation throughout the process, from planning to construction and start of commercial operations. An environmental expert f ollows up this plan . Sub - contra ctors are required to compile a n analysis of the probabilit y and potential consequences of hazardous environmental events during the construction phase. Sub - contractors are required to maintain and permanently update plan s o utlining measures to reduce the likelihood and consequences of such events. En viro nmental concerns in decision - making processes Projects fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be evaluated, selected and approved by the Treasury Department in cooperation with the relevant business unit at Agder Energi. An environmental specialist will be part of this,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Agder Energi’s Gre en Bond Framework 12 decision making process. Decision have to be taken in consensus, which gives the environmental perspective the power to veto decisions . Good reporting standar ds on climate gas emissions Agder Energi reports on the emission of some climate gasses in a detailed and well - structured manner. The company reports separately on local polluting emissions ( NOx ) and climate gas emissions ( CO 2 ). Reporting is provided for all of Agder Energi’s major operations as well as structured by area of operation (e.g. hydropower, district heating, grid activities etc.). Climate gas emissions are calculated by converting the total energy demand , and energy contained in u sed fuels , to electricity demand. Based on this demand, the equivalents of climate gas emissions are calculated based on both the European and the Norwegian g rid factors. Weaknesses Environmental overview of supply chain is insufficient The issuer does n ot have policies to analyze the CO 2 environmental record of sub - contractors and suppliers , nor is lifecycle analysis conducted in the decision - making process . Especially for large hydropower plants, construction periods can span over several years and requ ire heavy machinery. CICERO is encouraged to learn about the focus on local environmental impacts and the requirements Agder Energi is putting on sub - contractors in connection to the MOP program. H owever, including the CO 2 footprint of a sub - contractor into the policies and requirements that sub - contractors operate under , as well as reporting on these emissions, would strengthen the framework further . Pitfalls Impacts beyond the project boundary Due to the complexity of how socio - ec onomic activities impact the climate, a specific project is likely to have interactions with the broader community beyond the project borders. These interactions may or may not be climate - friendly, and thus need to be considered with regards to the net imp act of climate - related investments. Specifically with large hydro projects, there can be negative environmental impacts particularly during the construction phase. While local environmental impacts are considered in the MOP program, Agder Energi should tak e special considerations for large hydro projects on GHG emissions associated with construction vehicles and machinery.,CICERO ‘Second Opinion’ on Agder Energi’s Gre en Bond Framework 13 Appendix: About CICERO CICERO Center for International Climate Research is Norway’s foremost institute for interdisciplinary climate r esearch.
