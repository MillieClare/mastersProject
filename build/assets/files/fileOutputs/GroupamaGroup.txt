Founded in 1900, the Group serves approximately 11.5 million customers and has around 31,000 employees across 10 countries, primarily in Europe and some parts of Asia. Groupama offers a wide range of insurance products along with asset management and banking services to individuals, professionals, companies , and local authorities. 1 Groupama has developed the Groupama Green Bond Framework (the " Framework " ) under which it intends to issue one or more green bonds and use the proceeds to finance and/or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and/or future eligible green projects that de liver positive environmental outcomes and advance the Group ' s sustainability objectives. The Framework defines eligibility criteria in five areas : 1. Green Buildings 2. Renewable Energy 3. Environmentally Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources and Land Use 4. Clean Transportation 5. Energy Efficiency Groupama engaged Sustainalytics to review the Groupama Green Bond Framework , dated June 2021 , and provide a S econd - P arty O pinion on the F ramework ' s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 20 21 (GBP) . 2 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 3 Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ' Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics ' Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ' independent 4 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible project categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Part y Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • T he Framework ' s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 20 21 , as administered by ICMA ; • The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and • The alignment of the issuer ' s sustainabil ity strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.8 , which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ' ex pertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Groupama ' s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Groupama representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is t he sole responsibility of Groupama to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics ' opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. Any update of the present Second - P arty Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and Groupama . 1 The Groupama Group, “Groupama Assurances Mutuelles 2020 Universal Registration Document”, at: https://www.groupama.com/en/analysts/financial - publications/registration - documents/ 2 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ . 3 The Groupama Green Bond Framework is available on The Groupama Group’s website at: https://www.groupama.com/en/analysts/financing/green - bond/ 4 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustai nalytics and ensuring ana lyst independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust con flict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consistency of process, structural s eparation of commercial and research (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another i s transparency.,Second - Party Opinion Groupama Green Bond Framework 3 Sustainalytics ' Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment n or warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics ' Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the potential allocation of proceeds but does not gua rantee the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or argument , either in favou r or against, the truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that Groupama has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second - Party Opinion . Sustainalytics ' Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics ' Opinion on the Groupama Green Bond Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Groupama Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful and aligns to the four core components of the GBP. Sustainalytics highlights the follo wing elements of Groupama ' s Green Bond Framework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible categories — Green Buildings, Renewable Energy, Environmentally Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources and Land Use, Clean Transportation , and Energy Efficiency — are aligned with those recognized by the GBP. Sustainalytics notes that the following projects and activities will be financed primarily in France and the European Union . - Groupama has established a three - year lookback period for its re financing activities, which Sustainalytics considers to be in line with market practice. - Under the " Green Buildings " category, Groupama intends to utilize net proceeds to finance or refinance new, existing , or refurbished buildings that meet at least one o f the following criteria: ▪ Buildings that have received , or are expected to receive , a green building certification including BREEAM ( " Excellent " and above), LEED ( " Gold " and above) , or HQE ( " Excellent " and above). Sustainalytics views the certificate schem es as credible, and selected levels as impactful . For Sustainalytics ' assessment of green building certification schemes, please refer to Appendix 1. ▪ Buildings that have or are expected to have a net primary energy demand that is at least 10% lower than th e one resulting from the local Nearly Zero Energy Buildings ( " NZEB " ) requirements . - For the " Renewable Energy " category, the Group may finance the construction, development, acquisition, maintenance and operation of renewable energy projects, facilities and companies , including: ▪ Solar and wind power projects, and existing hydropower projects that are run - of - river with no artificial reservoir . - Under the " Environmentally Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources and Land Use " category, Groupama intends to invest in reforestation and afforestation projects in France. Eligible projects should have a sustainable forestry certification such as the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) . 5 Sustainalytics views these certification schemes as robust and credible. For Sustainalytics ' assessment of these forestry certification schemes, please refer to Appendix 2 . - Within the " Clean Transportation " category, the Group may invest in the development, construction, acqu isition, maintenance , and operation of the following: ▪ Electric rail infrastructure ; electric rolling stock for passenger and freight transportation ; and e lectric vehicle charging infrastructure. 5 PEFC, “Standards and Guides”, at: https://pefc.org/standards - implementation/standards - and - guides,Second - Party Opinion Groupama Green Bond Framework 4 ▪ Sustainalytics considers the financing of electric rolling st ock and electric vehicle charging infrastructure to be in line with market practice . Sustainalytics notes that the Framework excludes the financing of freight rolling stock used for fossil fuel transportation. - Within the “Energy Efficiency” category, the G roup may invest in the manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and repair of energy efficient devices and technologies such as smart grids and smart meters, automation and control systems for buildings and battery energy storage. Groupama's Framework all ows for allocation to “smart grid” investments which enable decarbonization of the grid and/or improve energy efficiency . While noting the variety of definitions and applications of “smart grid” technology, Sustainalytics views positively investments that are designed to improve grid efficiency and encourages Groupama to select projects that are clearly anticipated to deliver tangible efficiency improvements. - In addition, Sustainalytics notes the Framework has an exclusionary criterion for financing activities within certain sectors such as fossil fuel, nuclear, defense, alcohol, tobacco, and gambling. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the addition of an exclusionary criteria further strengthens the Framework. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - Groupama ' s process for project evaluation and selection will be managed by the Green Bond Committee ( " Committee " ). The Committee will comprise the Group ' s CFO and members of the Investment, Corporate Social Responsibility, and In vestor Relations Department. - The Committee will meet on an annual basis to review and approve eligible green projects (the " Eligible Assets " ) that are aligned with the criteria set forth in the Framework and relevant Groupama policies. The Committee will a lso be responsible for reviewing and updating the Framework as required. - Based on the establishment of a formal committee, Sustainalytics considers this evaluation and selection process to be in line with market practice . • Management of Proceeds: - Groupama will manage the proceeds of its green bonds on a portfolio basis and will maintain a level of allocation to the portfolio that matches the bond proceeds. The Group ' s Finance Department will be responsible for overseeing the management and allocation of the proceeds to Eligible Assets. - Groupama intends to reach full allocation within 36 months of issuance. Should any proceeds remain unallocated, they will be invested according to the Group ' s treasury policy on a temporary basis. - Based on these elements, Su stainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice . • Reporting: - Groupama will report on the allocation of net proceeds within one year of issuance, and subsequently on an annual basis until full allocation. Allocation reporting will incl ude (i) the total amount of proceeds allocated to Eligible Assets per category; (ii) the share of financing vs refinancing; and (iii) the details of unallocated proceeds. - In addition, Groupama intends on reporting on relevant impact metrics subject to avai lability. Impact metrics may include information such as number and level of green building certificates by scheme, CO2 emissions avoided, and hectares of forest area developed . - The Green Bond Committee will be responsible for reviewing and approving both the allocation and the impact report, which will be made available on the Group ' s website. - Based on the commitment to periodically report both portfolio allocation along with the reporting on category - wide impact indicators in the Framework , Sustainalytics considers this to be in line with market practice . Alignment with Green Bond Principles 20 21 Sustainalytics has determined that the Groupama Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP . For detailed information pleas e refer to Appendix 3 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form.,Second - Party Opinion Groupama Green Bond Framework 5 Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of Groupama Contribution of framework to The Groupama Group ' s sustainability strategy Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Groupama demonstrates a commitment to sustainability , driven by its " CSR Strategy 2019 - 2021 " that focuses on the environment and the community. 6 The key pillars of Groupama ' s strategy are: (i) enhancing employability, collaboration and diversity in the workplace, (ii) developing innovative and sustainable products and services, (iii) creating a positive impact on communities together with its suppliers and partners, and (iv) making responsible investments by taking environmental and social factor s into consideratio n . 6 Groupama focuses on ESG considerations in both its insurance as well as its investment activities, with internal measures to limit the environme ntal impact of its activities . 7 In 2020, the Group updated a series of initiatives aimed at curbing its exposure to fossil fuels. These initiatives include " no new investment in and a progressive exit from companies whose turnover or energy production mix is based more than 2 0% on coal [and] no new investment in companies for which oil sands represent more than 15% of total reserves. " 8 These exclusionary thresholds are meant to be reduced to eventually reach zero exposure in thermal coal in its EU and OEC D investment portfolio by 2030, and by 2040 at a global level. 9 The Group intends to finance one billion euros in new investments under this energy transition strategy between 2019 and 2021, and has already utilized 80% of the funds as of 2020. 9 The Group is committed towards enhancing the energy efficiency and the environmental quality of its real estate portfolio. 55% of Groupama ' s tertiary real estate portfolio is certified under HQE or BREEAM . Groupama is also a member of the Circolab Associat ion for the Circular Economy , 10 and the Booster du Réemploi, 11 which promotes the reuse of materials from old buildings. Groupama is also deploying measures to improve biodiversity and limit the impact of climate change on forests. 12 Some of the initiativ es undertaken by the Group include better adoption of tree species during reforestation and maintenance of water reserves to address the risk of forest fires. As of 2020, the Group estimates that 10.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide had been absorbed by the 22,00 0 hectares of forest owned by the Group in France. Sustainalytics views Groupama ' s commitment to reduce its fossil fuel exposure as impactful and encourages Groupama to set quantifiable targets in other areas to advance its sustainability strategy . Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Groupama Green Bond Framework is aligned with the Group ' s overall sustainability strategy and initiatives and will further the Group ' s action on its key environmental priorities . Well - positioned to addre ss common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the net proceeds from the bonds issued under the Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are expected to have positive environment al impact, Sustainalytics is aware that such eligible projects could also lead to negative environmental and social outcomes. Some key environmental and social risks associated with the eligible projects could include occupational health and safety, land - u se change and biodiversity loss , and community relations. Although Groupama has a limited role in the development of specific eligible projects which it is financing, Sustainalytics considers that the following mechanisms, systems, and procedures in place will help mitigate the associated risks . The Group has in place a n Ethics Charter ( " Charte éthique " ), which outlines the values that are expected to be followed by all of its agents and employees . 13 As part of the Code, the Group commits to upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the labour standards set by the International Labo u r Organization, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. In addition, the Group adheres to the CSR Charter from the French Insurance Federation (Charte RSE de la Fédération Française de l ' Assurance) , which is structured around three areas of responsibility: insurers, employers and responsible investors .

Groupama has in place a Group Risk Committee, comprised of members of the Group Executive Committee and the Head of the Risk Managemen t Function , overseeing the application of its risk monitoring system. The Group also has a risk committee for each business unit , including insurance, financial, operational and conformity , and s ince 2016, Groupama has been using a risk management system b ased on the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ( “ ORSA ” ). 14 As a large forest owner, Groupama monitors its forests for storms, forest fires , and pest s to protect biodiversity . All of the forest s owned by the Group are PEFC certified. 15 Through Groupama Immobilier, the Group signed the Biodiversity Pledge, 16 which seeks to " include more planted areas, foster the development of fauna, and encourage urban agriculture in every existing or planned urb an project ." 17 The Group has been a signatory to the Charter of the Sustainable Building Plan since 2014 and has a “Green Works Charter” (Charte Travaux Verts) that covers the choice of construction materials and addresses nuisances on construction sites. 18 Groupama Immobilier's Integrated Quality - Environment Management System is ISO 9001: Quality Management Systems, and ISO 14001: Environmental Management certified for its investment, management and valuation activities of real estate assets. 19 The Group has a risk management policy covering both financial and non - financial aspects. For the non - financial aspects, the risk mitigation processes cover environmental, social and governance considerations. As of 2020, approximately 75% of the Groups financial a ssets had integrated ESG and climate change risks criteria in the investment process. Furthermore, Groupama Asset Management is a signatory of the Principles for Responsible Investment ( “ PRI ” ) , which promotes long - term responsible investment and the incorp oration of ESG factors. 20 Groupama's responsible investment strategy is applied throughout the various entities within the Group – Groupama Asset Management (fixed income management and dedicated funds), Groupama Assurances Mutuelles (infrastructures, private equity, and private de bt investments), Groupama Immobilier (real estate and forestry), and Groupama Gan Vie (life and health insurance contracts). 21 Groupama has communicated to Sustainalytics that it is in the process of strengthening its evaluation of third parties it works w ith. Sustainalytics encourages to make any relevant subsequently developed policies publicly available when launched . Furthermore, France is classified as a " Designated Country " under the Equator Principles, implying the presence of environment and social governance systems, legislation, and institutional capacity for protecting the environment and communities. 22 Based on these policies, standards and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Groupama has implemented adequate measures and is well - p ositioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible categories. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All four use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP. Sustainalytics has focused below on where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context . The role of insurance companies in advancing a low - carbon economy Insurance companies are both highly impacted by and well - positioned to take action against climate change. Climate change is already causing an increase loss of life linked to the frequency and severity of extreme weather - related disasters. 23 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 2030 - 2050 climate change will lead t o an additional 250,000 deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea , and heat 14 Groupama, “Intégration des infromations extra - financières dans les decisions d’investissement Groupama Gan Vie”, at: https://www.groupama.com/wp - content/uploads/2021/04/Politique - de - finance - durable - Groupama - Gan - Vie - SFDR - art - 3 - 4 - 5.pdf 15 Groupama, “ForestAssets”, at: https://www.groupama - immobilier.com/patrimoine/patrimoine - actifs - forestiers/ 16 Groupama, “International call to action.

A report by UNEP has est imated that the “ decade leading to 2030 represents the most critical period for the world to bend the global emissions curve in order to achieve the aims of the Paris Agreement. ” 25 Furthermore, the decade from 2010 - 2019 was the costliest in the modern reco rd of natural disasters , with economic loss es adding up to USD 2.98 trillion, 44% above the total for the previous decade. 26 In Europe , in 2018, it is estimated that the monetized cost of heat - related mortality was equivalent to 1 - 2% of regional gross nati onal income . 27 In this context, financing initiatives that mitigate environmental risk are aligned with the business objectives of large insurance companies. In addition to being highly exposed to climate change risks, insurance companies operate on a larg e scale and are well placed to support significant investments that enable climate resilience. According to the OECD, the world needs USD 6.9 trillion a year through 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement goals. 28 The Sustainable Insurance Forum (SIF) has identi fied that, with more than USD 31 trillion in assets under management, the insurance sector can use this capital base to leverage support for investments that respond to sustainability challenges . 29 Sustainalytics considers that eligible investments under t he Framework have the potential to support building socioeconomic resilience to mitigate and better cope with the effects of climate change . The impacts of g reen b uildings in the EU The building sector is one of the most resource - consuming sectors in the EU , accounting for 40% of the bloc’s primary energy consumption and 36% of CO 2 emissions. 30 Considering the lifespan of buildings, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has noted that without ambitious polic ies to improve efficiency in the built environment , we risk locking in carbon - intensive options for several decades. 31 In Europe, 85% of the building stock was built before 2001 , and it is estimated that 85 - 95% of buildings of the current building stock wi ll still be standing in 2050. 32 Energy efficiency has been identified as a key area that will contribute to reaching the EU’s 2030 target of reducing GHG emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels, given that 75% of the EU’s current building stock is energy inefficient. 33 Building renovation has a major role to play in the greening of the EU’s building sector. To achieve the 2030 target, the EU’s buildings stock GHG emissions should be reduced by 60%, final energy consumption by 14%, and energy consumption f or heating and cooling by 18%. 34 Building renovations have the potential to reduce energy consumption by 5 - 6% and CO 2 emissions by 5%, highlighting the significance of accelerating the current energy renovation rate of buildings. 35 Doubling the annual reno vation rate of commercial and residential building s and fostering deep energy renovations would mean that almost 35 million building units 36 are renovated, advancing the EU climate objectives. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Groupama’s financing of new green buildings and the renovation of the current building stock can provide positive environmental impact and contribute to the EU’s 2030 GHG emissions reduction target. 24 WHO, “Climate Change and Health” (2018), at: https://www.who.int/news - room/fact - sheets/detail/climate - change - and - health . 25 UNEP, “Insuri ng the climate transition: Enhancing the insurance industry’s assessment of climate change futures” (2021), at: https://www.unepfi.org/psi/wp - content/uploads/20 21/01/PSI - TCFD - final - report.pdf 26 Aon, “Weather, Climate & Catastrophe Insight” (2019), at: http://thoughtlea dership.aon.com/Documents/20200122 - if - natcat2020.pdf?utm_source=ceros&utm_medium=storypage&utm_campaign=natcat20 . 27 Watts, N., Amman, M. et al.

Sustainalytics considers that the projects funded by the green bond proceeds are expected to have provide positive environmental impact. The Groupama Green Bond Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the Groupama Green Bond Framework is a ligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use of proce eds categories will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 7, 9, 11 and 15 . Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Gro upama has adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that The Groupama Group is well - positi oned to issue green bonds and that the Groupama Green Bond Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 20 21 .,Second - Party Opinion Groupama Green Bond Framework 9 Appendi ces Appendix 1: Certification Schemes for Green Buildings BREEAM LEED HQE Background BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) was first published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in 1990. Based in the UK. Used for new, refurbished and extension of existing buildings. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a US Certification System for residential and commercial buildings used worldwide. LEED was developed by the non - profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). The Haute Qualité Environneme ntale or HQE (High Quality Environmental standard) is a standard for green building in France, based on the principles of sustainable development first set out at the 1992 Earth Summit. The standard was launched in 2005 and is controlled by HQE and certifi cate is issued by Cerway/ Certivea/ Cerqual. Certification levels Pass Good Very Good Excellent Outstanding • Certified • Silver • Gold • Platinum • Pass • Good • Very good • Excellent • Exceptional Areas of Assessment • Energy • Land Use and Ecology • Pollution • Transport • Materials • Water • Waste • Health and Wellbeing • Innovation • Energy and atmosphere • Sustainable Sites • Location and Transportation • Materials and resources • Water efficiency • Indoor environmental quality • Innovation in Design • Regional Priority • Energy • Environment (Site, Components, Worksite, Water, Waste, Maintenance) • Comfort (Hydrothermal, Acoustic, Visual, Olfactory) • Health (Spaces quality, Air Quality, Water Quality) • Principles of Equivalence Requirements Prerequisites depending on the levels of certification and credits with associated points This number of points is then weighted by item 35 and gives a BREEAM level of certification, which is based on the overall score obtained (expressed as a percentage). Majority of BREEAM issues are flexible, meaning that the client can choose which to comply with to build their BREEAM performance score. BRE E AM has two stages/ audit reports: a ' BREEAM Design Stage ' and a ' Post Construction Stage ' , with d ifferent assessment criteria. Prerequisites independent of level of certification, and credits with associated points. These points are then added together to obtain the LEED level of certification There are several different rating systems within LEED. Each rating system is designed to apply to a specific sector (e.g., New Construction, Major Renovation, Core and Shell Development, Schools - /Retail - /Healthcare New Construction and Major Renovations, Existing Buildings: Operation and Maintenan ce). Prerequisites (independent of level of certification) + Points - based performance level: Performing and High Performing The Prerequisite level is obtained when all the minimum requirements for a target are met, while the Performing and High Performin g levels are obtained based on a percentage of points given per target, allowing for flexibility. Based on the total number of stars obtained per area, an overall HQE level is then given. Environmental certificates are assigned at all stages of the buil ding life cycle, and on - site audits are required. Performance display Qualitative Considerations Used in more than 70 countries: Good adaptation to the local normative context. Predominant environmental focus. Widely recognized internationally, and strong assurance of overall quality. HQE certification has the most number of targets concerning individuals. The " Comfort " and " Health " related themes are the most developed in this scheme. The HQE scheme recognises European and,Second - Party Opinion Groupama Green Bond Framework 10 BREEAM certification is less strict (less minimum thresholds) than HQE and LEED certifications. international standards (in particular the ISO and ASHRAE standards). Appendix 2: Assessmen t of forestry certification schemes Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) 37 Background Founded in 1999, the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) is a non - profit organization that promotes sustainable forest management through independent third - party certification, this includes assessments, endorsements and recognitio n of national forest certification systems. PEFC was created in response to the specific requirements of small - and family forest owners as an international umbrella organization. Basic Principles ● Maintenance and appropriate enhancement of forest resources and their contribution to the global carbon cycle ● Maintenance and enhancement of forest ecosystem health and vitality ● Maintenance and encouragement of productive functions of forests (wood and no - wood) ● Maintenance, conservation and appropriate en hancement of biological diversity in forest ecosystems ● Maintenance and appropriate enhancement of protective functions in forest management (notably soil and water) ● Maintenance of socioeconomic functions and conditions ● Compliance with legal requirements T ypes of standards/benc hmarks ● Sustainable Forest Management benchmark – international requirements for sustainable forest management. National forest management standards must meet these requirements in order to obtain PEFC endorsement ● Group Forest Manage ment Certification – outlines the requirements for national forest certification systems who have group forest management certification ● Standard Setting – covers the processes that must be adhered to during the development, review and revision of national forest management standards ● Chain of Custody – outlines the conditions for obtaining CoC certification for forest - based products ● PEFC logo Usage Rules – outlines the requirements entities must abide by when using the PEFC logo ● Endorsement of National Syst ems – outlines the process that national systems must go through to achieve PEFC endorsement Governance PEFC's governance structure is formed by the General Assembly (GA) which is the highest authority and decision - making body. It is made up of all PEFC members, including national and international stakeholders. In general, PEFC's governance structure is mor e representative of industry and government stakeholders than of social or environmental groups. Members vote on key decisions including endorsements, international standards, new members, statutes and budgets. All national members have between one and sev en votes, depending on membership fees, while international stakeholder members have one vote each. Scope Multi - stakeholder participation is required in the governance of national schemes as well as in the standard - setting process. Standards and normativ e documents are reviewed periodically at intervals that do not exceed five years. The PEFC Standard Setting standard is based on ISO/IEC Code for good practice for standardization (Guide 59) 38 and the ISEAL Code of Good Practice for Setting Social and Envi ronmental Standards. Chain - of - Custody ● Quality or environmental management systems (ISO 9001:2008 or ISO 14001:2004 respectively) may be used to implement the minimum requirements for chain - of - custody management systems required by PEFC ● Only accredited certification bodies can undertake certification ● CoC requirements include specifications for physical separation of wood and percentage - based methods for products with mixed content. 37 PEFC, Standards and Implementation: https://www.pefc.org/standards - implementation 38 ISO, ISO/IEC Guide 59:2019: https://www.is o.org/standard/23390.html,Second - Party Opinion Groupama Green Bond Framework 11 ● The CoC standard includes specifications for tracking and coll ecting and maintaining documentation about the origin of the materials ● The CoC standard includes specifications for the physical separation of certified and non - certified wood ● The CoC standard includes specifications about procedures for dealing with compl ains related to participant's chain of custody Non - certified wood sources The PEFC's Due Diligence System requires participants to establish systems to minimize the risk of sourcing raw materials from: a. forest management activities that do not comply with local, national or international laws related to: - operations and harvesting, including land use conversion, - management of areas with designated high environmental and cultural values, - protected and endangered species, including CITES species, - health a nd labour issues, - indigenous peoples' property, tenure and use rights, - payment of royalties and taxes. b. genetically modified organisms, c. forest conversion, including conversion of primary forests to forest plantations. Accreditation/ve rification Accreditation is carried out by an accreditation body (AB). In the same way that a certification body checks that a company meets the PEFC standard, the accreditation body checks that a certification body meets specific PEFC and ISO requirements. Through the accreditation process, PEFC has assurance that certification bodies are independent and impartial, that they follow PEFC certification procedures. PEFC does not have their own accreditation body. Like with the majority of ISO based certifications, PEFC relies on national ABs under the umbrella of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF). National ABs need to be a member of the IAF, which means they must follow IAF's rules and regulations. Qualitative considerations Sustainalytics views PEFC as being a robust and credible standard that is based on comprehensive principles and criteria that are aligned with ISO. The scheme has received praise for its contribution to sustainable forest management practice s and has also faced criticism from civil society actors. In certain instances, this standard goes above and beyond national regulation and is capable of providing a high level of assurance that sustainable forest management practices are in place. Howev er, in other cases, the standard is similar or equal to national legislation and provides little additional assurance. Ultimately, the level of assurance that can be provided by the scheme is contingent upon several factors including the certification bodi es conducting audits, national regulations and local context.

Second - Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second - Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer ' s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second - Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer ' s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of proje cts intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with inte rnal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria.,Second - Party Opinion Groupama Green Bond Framework 16 Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer ' s intern al tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may v erify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scena rio. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion Groupama Green Bond Framework 17 Disclaimer Copyright ©202 1 Sustainalytics.
