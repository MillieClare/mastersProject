Green Bond 2 Introduction Activia Properties Inc. (“API”) has developed a green bond framework (the “framework”) under which it is planning to issue green bonds and use the proceeds to finance/refinance expenditures related to green buildings . API engaged Sustainalytics to review the framework and provide a second - party opinion on the alignment of the green bond w ith the Green Bond Principles 2018 (the “GBP”), as administered by the International Capital Market Association (the “ICMA”) , 1 Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2017, established by the Japanese Ministry of Environment, and the framework’s environmental creden tials. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of API ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of API ’s green bond. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains two sections: Framework Overview – summary of the API Green Bond framework ; and Sustainalytics’ Opinion – an opinion on the framework. Overview of Issuer API , a Japanese real estate investment trust (J - REIT) , wa s established on September 7, 2011 under the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations of Japan. API was listed on the Real Estate Investment Trust Securities Market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Securities code: 3279) on June 13, 2012. API prima rily focuses on investments in urban retail properties and office buildings across Tokyo in Japan. As of January 10 , 201 9 , the total number of properties owned is 4 5 with total acquisition price of 502.0 billion yen. 2 In accordance with API’s investment policy, the operation and management of its assets are entrusted to the asset manager, TLC REIT Management Inc. (“TRM”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tokyu Land Corporation, a comprehensive real estate company in Japan. API has declared its commitment to reduce energy consumption in its entire portfolio as well as in each of its properties by an average of 1% per year in the medium - to long - term perspective, and discloses the environmental performance of its portfolio on its website on a regular basis. Through such environmental initiatives, API has been designated by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) Real Estate Assessment as “Sector Leader” in “ Diversified - Office/Retail/Asia” for the two consecutive years since 20 17. Furthermore, it obtained the highest grade “Green Star” for the five consecutive years since 2014 and received the highest rating of “5 - star” in “GRESB Rating”, an overall assessment calculated relative to the global performance of reporting entities w hich was introduced in 2016. In addition to the above, API is committed to promoting green buildings by achieving certification for the buildings held. As of November 30, 2018, API owns 16 buildings certified by CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environmental Efficiency), 8 buildings certified by the DBJ Green Building Certification Program, and 6 buildings certified by BELS (Building - Housing Energy - efficiency Labeling System). In order to further promote its environmental objective and cer tified green buildings, API is planning to issue green bonds. 1 ICMA’s Green Bond Principles 2018 https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ 2 https://www.activia - reit.co.jp/file/en - news - 72e402946d33f 4607a7136b3e4eb36df7c603bb6.pdf,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Activia Properties Inc. Green Bond 3 Framework Overview For the purpose of issuing green bonds, API has developed the following framework which addresses the four key core components of the Green Bond Principles (GBP): use of proceeds, project evaluation and selection process, management of proceeds, and reporting. The framework belongs to API , and a summary overview has been provided below. Use of Proceeds The proceeds of the green bond will be allocated to acquire the existing or new buildings that meet the Eligibility Criteria A (‘Eligible Green Projects’) , or refurbishments that meet the following eligibility criteria B or to refinance the existing lo an /investment corp oration bonds which have been allocated to E ligible G reen Pro jects or refurbishments . Eligibility Criteria 1. GREEN BUILDINGS and ENERGY EFFICIENCY API shall apply one or more of the following criteria to allocate the proceeds into Eligible Pro jects : A. Buildings that have achieved the following top two levels of third - party green building certification/recertification within 36 months prior to the payment date of green bonds or will achieve: - A or S Rank under CASBEE - 4 or 5 Stars under DBJ Green Building Certification Program - 4 or 5 Stars under BELS B. Refurbishments with a primary purpose of achieving one of the following criteria and are completed within 36 months prior to the payment date of green bond or will be completed: - Refurbishments with more than 10% reduction in CO 2 emissions or energy consumption - Refurbishments with more than 10% reduction in water consumption - Newly achieve the top two levels of green building certifications listed above or more than one level of star/rank improv ement in the green building certifications Project Evaluation and Selection Process Application of Eligibility and Exclusionary Criteria in Project Selection API declares that it will use the proceeds to finance the acquisition of buildings that meet the Eligibility Criteria A or finance refurbishments that meet the Eligibility Criteria B, or refinance the loans or finance redemption of bonds that have been allocated to Eligible Green Projects or refurbishments , and not use the proceeds for the purpos es other than the above, excluding the portion allocated to the costs associated with the issuance of the green bonds. Eligible Projects are evaluated and selected based on eligible criteria by the Investment Committee of TRM, which comprises the President & CEO, the Chief Division Officer of Activia Management Division, the General Manager of Asset Investment Department, the General Manager of Finance & Acco unting Department , the General Manager of Corporate Planning & Administration Department, t he General Manager of Environmental Engineering Department, the General Manager of Compliance Department, General Manager of Asset Management Department in Activia Management Division and General Manager of Strategy Department in Activia Management Divisio n. Environmental Objectives API invests primarily in urban retail and Tokyo office properties. API seeks to increase unitholder value by building a portfolio of properties that are competitive in the medium - to long - term and operating it. To this end, AP I strongly believes that reducing environmental footprint and contributing to our surrounding environment as well as local communities are also important factors to build a portfolio of properties that can expect stable and sustainable customer demand its real estate portfolio, in addition to other factors such as location, use, size and quality. In order to embody its vision, API aims to receive the relevant environmental certification for more than one property every year. It has been awarded the certific ation for three properties in 2013, two in 2014, seven in 2015, ten in 2016, four in 2017 and four in 2018. In conformity to the Act on the Rational Use of Energy (Energy Conservation Law), API has set out an annual average cutting target of 1% in each ene rgy sources for API's entire portfolio and also for each property in the medium - to long - term.,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Activia Properties Inc. Green Bond 4 Process to Mitigate Environmental and Social Risks API has established a system to identify and manage environmental and social risks. More specifically, it regu larly monitors the progress of its sustainability goals, measures and related data on properties and hold meetings at Activia Management Division led by the Chief Division Officer of Activia Management Division with the General Manager of Asset Management Department, Activia Management Division, General Manager of Strategy Department, Activia Management Division and other members to report and discuss the progress, key issues and solutions. The Chief Division Officer of Activia Management Division of TRM ov ersees the execution of businesses as the person responsible for API asset management. Accordingly, approval by Chief Division Officer of Activia Management Division is required for the execution of plans or solutions. Management of Proceeds API extracts the Eligible Green Projects out of API’s portfolio and calculates the Debts of Eligible Green Projects by multiplying the calculable total book value of the Eligible Green Projects by its calculable book value LTV (Loan to Value / based on int erest - bearing debt) ratio as of the end of the latest fiscal period prior to the date of each bond issuance. API will then monitor to ensure that the total amount of outstanding green bonds does not exceed the debts of Eligible Green Projects. Payment of p rincipal and interest on the green bonds will be made from API’s general funds and will not be directly linked to the performance of any Eligible Green Projects. API will disclose that the n et proceeds from the green bonds will be immediately, or shortly thereafter, fully allocated to finance the acquisition of buildings that meet the Eligibility Criteria A, or finance refurbishments that meet the Eligibility Criteria B, or refinance the loans or finance redemption of bonds that have been allocated to Eligible Green Projects or refurbishments . If the proceeds from the green bonds are temporarily not allocated to finance the acquisition of buildings that meet the following Eligibility Criteria A, or finance refurbishments that meet the Eligibility C riteria B, or refinance the loans or finance redemption of bonds that have been allocated to Eligible Green Projects or refurbishments , API will identify the unallocated amount of the funds and manage them in cash or cash equivalents until they are allocat ed. Reporting Allocation Reporting API will disclose on its website the list of Eligible Green P roject s or refurbishments financed/refinanced, allocation status, including the amount of unallocated proceeds, schedule of allocation and managing method, o f the net proceeds of green bonds as of end of every May until the proceeds are fully allocated. It will also disclose that the total amount of outstanding green bonds does not exceed the Debts of Eligible Green Projects. Furthermore, after issuance, for a s long as the green bonds are outstanding, it will annually report on the book value of all the Eligible Green Projects, the Debts of Eligible Green Projects and the total amount of outstanding amount of the green bonds as of the last day of May in each ye ar. Impact Reporting As long as there i s an unredeemed balance of the relevant green bonds, API will annually disclose summary and the progress and levels of certifications of Eligible Green Projects . Additionally, API will annually disclose the following indicators of Eligible Green Projects where API has energ y control authority: - Energy consumption - CO 2 emissions - Water consumption - Amount of industrial waste generated As for the refurbishments that hav e been funded by the green bonds, the environmental benefits brought by each project will be disclosed. API will indicate an estimated rate of reduction (%) of energy consumption or water usage or CO 2 emissions before and after the refurbishment.,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Activia Properties Inc. Green Bond 5 S ustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the API Green Bond Framework Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the API Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond P rinciples 2018 and with Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2017 . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of API ’s green bond framework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligibility criter ia of its use of proceeds, Green Buildings and Energy Efficiency, are recog nized by the Green Bond Principles as project categor ies with positive environmental benefits. - Stron g alignment with credible third - party standards , namely DBJ Green Building Certification and CASBEE, signals adherence to global market standards. Sustainalytics views positively that only the top two levels of certification within these schemes are specified , and considers that the framework ’ s inclusion of only those levels is in line with market best practice . (Please refer to Appendix 1 for our a ssessment on these certifications). - API ’s has set a threshold of 10% improvement in energy use, water use, or CO 2 emissions in order for a project to qualify as eligible for the green bond(s). While Sustainalytics acknowledges that a 30 - 50 % improvement in emission intensity for r efurbished buildings may be considered best practice, 3 Sustainalytics considers even smaller improvements to provide environmental benefits, and encourages the issuer to prioritize projects with the greatest positive impacts and to report transparently on outcomes. - API is committed to using the net proceeds of the bond to refinance projects w hich have achieved certification or recertification within the 36 months preceding issuance . Sustainalytics views this look back period as acceptable considering that green buildings will sustain positive environmental impacts . • Project Selection Process: - Eligible projects are selected and evaluated by TRM’s Investment Committee, which includes senior management from TRM including the President & CEO, the Chief Division Officer of the Activia Management Division, and the General Managers of the Asset Investment, Environment al Engineer ing , Compliance, Corporate Planning & Administration and Finance & Accounting Departments . - Sustainalytics considers this approach and the inclusion of C - level management in the project selection process to be in line with market best practice. • Management of Proceeds: - API intends to allocat e the net proceeds of the green bond to Eligible Proj ect s immediately, or shortly after , issuance. Pending allocation, unallocated funds will be held in cash or cash equivalents. API will track the allocation of proceeds and ensure that, as of the end of each fiscal period, the amount allocated does not surpass the debts of eligible green projects. This process is in line with market practice. - Sustainalytics considers this approach to be in line with market practice . • Reporting: - API is committed to reporting, on an annual basis as long as green bonds are outstanding , the list of Eligible Green Projects or refurbishments financed/refinanced , the amounts allocated , the book value of all eligible green projects, the amount of unallocated proceeds, schedule of allocation and managing method, and the net procee ds of green bonds . This disclosure is in line with market practice. - API is committed to reporting annually on key environmental performance indicators including information on certifications and energy consumption, water consumption, and CO 2 emissions of eligible green properties . Sustainalytics notes that reporting on savings or avoided emissions for not only refurbishment projects but also all Eligible Green Projects financed/refinanced would provide additional 3 As per CBI, a minimum improvement in emissions intensity of 50% is required for bond terms of 30 years and 30% for bond terms of 5 years. https://www.climatebonds.net/standard/buildings/upgrade,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Activia Properties Inc. Green Bond 6 clarity, that there are metho dological difficulties which make this complex to disclose. Th e disclosure provided is in line with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that the API G reen B ond F ramework aligns to the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018. For detailed information please refer to Appendix 2: Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Alignment with Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2017 The Japanese Green Bond Guidelines communicate what a n issuer should do to issue a credible green bond, and also highlight what an issuer is recommended to do. Sustainalytics assessed the alignment between the API ’s green bond framework and the ‘requirements of’ items outlined in the Japan’s Green Bond Guide lines. ICMA Green Bond Principles and Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines, 2017 4 Alignment with GBP and with Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines? Sustainalytics’ comments on alignment with Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines. 5 1. Use of Proceeds Yes API ’ s selected eligible criteria, green buildings and energy efficiency, are clearly suggested as green projects with clear environmental benefits in the Japanese green bond guidelines. Additionally, the information on the green bond proceeds, green project categories as well as the process to mitigate the negative impacts are all described in the framework and will be accessible to the investors. 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection Yes API has, in complement to its goal of ensuring unitholder return, stated an objec tive of minimizing its environmental footprint . Furthermore, A PI has a committed to energy efficiency targets and will pursue green building certifications and building upgrades where feasible, which aligns with th e objectives of the green bond. 3. Management of Proceeds Yes API ’s framework states the intention to allocate the proceeds of the green bond immediately after issuance, or shortly thereafter. Any unallocated proceeds will be held in cash and cash equivalents , which will be tracked by A PI . 4. Reporting Yes API has confirmed that its reporting on the bond will be annual and will include the list of Eligible Green Projects or refurbishments financed/refinanced , the amounts allocated , the book value of all eligible green projects, and the amount of unallocated proceeds , as well as impact indicators including the green building certifications achieved , and energy consumption, water consumption, CO2 emissions , and a mount of industrial wast e generated of eligible green properties. Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of the Issuer 4 Green Bond Guidelines, 2017, Summary, Ministry of the Environment, Japan https://www.env.go.jp/en/policy/economy/gb/summary2017.pdf 5 For detailed comments on alignment with ICMA GBP, please see Appendix .,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Activia Properties Inc. Green Bond 7 Contribution of framework to issuer’s sustainability strategy and targets In complement to its mission to maximize unitholder value, 6 API states a goal of reducing its environmental footprint and “ contributing to the surrounding communities and environment ” in order to build a stable and sustainable portfolio. 7 In practice, that means that API has committed to policies and undertaken initia tives to help mitigate their environmental impact. These include: • Obtaining building certifications from reputable organizations such as the DBJ Green Building Certification from the Development Bank of Japan, Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Envi ronmental Efficiency (CASBEE), and BELS (established by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism. As of November 30, 2018 , o verall API has certified a total of 30 properties, including nine at the highest level of the respective schemes . 8 • The achievement of a Green Star rating from GRESB, indicating top - scoring marks on a survey of environmental and sustainability practices. 9 • Specific initiatives undertaken at retail, office, and other properties. API has identified five focus areas – reducing CO 2 emissions, conserving biodiversity, conserving water, saving resources, and human health – as focus for targeted building upgrades such as installation of vegetation, LED and natural lighting, and sustainable materials use. 10 • Tracking of the environmental performance of their building portfolio over several quantitative dimension s, including energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, water consumption, water recycling, and waste generation . 11 • Compliance with the Act on the Rational Use of Energy, API has established an annual average target for energy reduction, at both the portfolio level and for each individual property , over the long term. Based on the demonstrated record of achieving environmental certification, and the commitment to future energy reductions in line with statutory requirements, Sustainalytics considers API well - positioned to issue green bonds. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects By investing green buildings, or refurbishi ng existing buildings to improve performance, the use of proceeds of the API green bonds will deliver environmental benefits. Nevertheless, the buildings and real estate sector may be exposed to environmental and social risks, including but not limited to, worker health and safety, community and stakeholder support, and environmental impacts of the construction processes such as air, water, and soil pollution. API , as well as the asset manager TLC REIT Management Inc . , a member of the Tokyu Land Holdings Gr oup , have policies and procedures in place. At the level of corporate governance, API has an organizational structure which emphasizes internal controls, 12 as well as an Acquisition Approval Process which lays out the steps and approvals which must be taken before a new property is acquired, including that the Compliance Committee ensure that the “ proposal conforms to applicable legislation and other compliance - related m atters .” 13 TRM has in place a policy which “ has established specific safeguards and procedures ” for addressing “Antisocial Forces”, which may include illegal, unethical, or improper business activities. 14 At the operational level, API has undertaken surveys to engage with its stakeholders, nam ely employees and tenants. 15 Based on the processes in places, Sustainalytics considers API to be well - positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects funded by the green bonds. Sustainalytics further encourages AP I to publically disclose its formal risk mitigation policies.

Green Bond 8 Japan’s energy strategy has historically focused on the development of nuclear power , which by 2011 generated 30% of the nation’s electricity. 16 Subsequently, i n the wake of the Fukushima - Dai i chi nuclear disaster , the Japanese government ordered a nation - wide closure of its reactors, forcing Japan to rely heavily on energy imp orts , particularly of fossil fuels, in order to meet its energy n eeds. However, due to economic needs , emissions reduction targets , and self - sufficiency goals, Japan has recently re - affirmed its commitment to including nuclear power in its supply mix, whil e continuing to emphasize the importance of renewables and efficiency. 17 Buildings make up a significant part of Japan’s overall energy demands, accounting for 33% of t otal energy use, while in Tokyo that figure reaches as high as two thirds. 18 Within the office building sector specifically, air cond itioning is responsible for 50% of energy demand, lighting and office equipment for 30% , and elevators for 20%. 19 According to the 2018 International Energy Efficiency Scorecard Japan ranks 15 th out of 25 countri es assessed for the energy efficiency of its building sector. 20 In 2015, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism launched the Building Energy Efficiency Act as a means of increas ing the efficiency of buildings; 21 t he A ct includes regulations setting energy efficiency standards for non - residential buildings . 22 Given this context, it is expected that enhancements to energy efficiency in buildings will continue to increase in Japan. Therefore, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the use of proceeds of API ’s green bond will play a key role in financ ing green buildings, creating positive environmental impact while supporting Japan in meeting its own climate targets. 16 Nuclear Power in Japan, World Nuclear Association http://www.world - nuclear.org/information - library/country - profiles/countries - g - n/japan - nuclear - power.aspx 17 https://www.reuters.com/article/japan - energy/japan - backs - role - of - nuclear - power - in - 2030 - energy - plan - idUSL3N1SN0TE 18 https://www.eu - japan.e u/sites/eu - japan.eu/files/Nishida.pdf 19 Energy Efficiency (2009) Overview of energy consumption and GHG mitigation technologies in the building sector in Japan http://environmentportal.in/files/Overview%20of%20energy%20consumption%20and%20GHG%20mitigation. pdf 20 https://aceee.org/sites/default/files/publications/researchreports/i1801.pdf 21 Overview of the Building Energy Efficiency Act (Japanese), Ministry of Land Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan http://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001178846.pdf 22 Overview of the Act on the improvement of Energy Consumption Performance of Buildings (Building Energy Efficiency Act), Minis try of Land Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001134876.pdf,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Activia Properties Inc.

Green buildings may include those certified by the Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE) or DBJ Green Building Certification Program . Energy efficiency projects includes improvements that have resulting in decreased of CO 2 emissions by at least 10 %. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the projects described by the framework will support its ongoing strategy of balancing environmental impacts with financial decisions and will deliver positive environment al benefits. All use of proceeds categories specified in the framework are aligned with those of the Green Bond Principles 2018 , API has processes in place for project evaluation and selection, and of proceeds in line with market practice ; and commitment s have been made to r eport on allocation and impacts. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the initiatives funded by the green bonds will contribute to the advancement of UN Sustainable Development Goals 7 & 11.

The programme is recognized as one o f the leading regional standards. The certification is available for office buildings, logistics, residential & retail facilities. CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency) represents a green building management system from Japan, evaluating and rating the environmental performance of buildings and the built environment. CASBEE is formed of four assessment tools tailored to different scales: housing, building, district and city. BELS (Building - Housing Energy - efficiency Labelling System) is an energy performance label, issued under guidelines established by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism. The BELS system evaluates primary energy consumption to measure conservation performance. Certification levels 1 Star 2 Stars 3 Stars 4 Stars 5 Stars C (Poor) B - (Slightly Poor) B+ (Good) A (Very Good) S (Excellent) 1 Star 2 Stars 3 Stars 4 Stars 5 Stars Areas of Assessment: Environmental Project Management Evaluation of DBJ Green Building Certification includes construction specifications, environmental features as well as social factors. CASBEE assesses two main factors: inside and outside the building site, which translate into Q (Built Environment Quality) and, respectively, L (Built Env ironment Load). None Areas of Assessment: Environmental Performance of the Building Assessment includes three areas. Each area includes additional subcateg ories: • Ecology • Risk management & amenities/diversity • Community & partnership • Energy Efficiency • Resource efficiency • Local environment • Indoor environment • Energy efficiency Requirements Score - based performance level There are three main areas comprised of additional subcategories a full score of 100 points. In addition to the regular points, an ad ditional point system is employed. In the final process, JREI will conduct on the ground review of building performance on the indicators above, and a committee set in JREI will decide the result of certification rank. 26 Score - based performance level CASBEE uses the BEE (Built Environment Efficiency) as its assessment indicator, which is calculated from Q (Built Environment Quality) as the numerator and L (Built Environment Load) as the denominator. Q and L are obtained through the classification and r earrangement of the four areas of assessment. Buildings may receive ranks ranging from C (poor) to S (excellent), in order of increasing BEE value. Score - based performance level. The BELS score is based on the Building Energy Index, obtained by comparing the energy consumption of a building to the standard primary energy consumption of the building type in offici al guidelines. A two - star rating is equivalent to meeting existing energy conservation standards, with higher star ratings implying greater savings. 23 Certification Overview , Dev elopment Bank of Japan; http://www.dbj.jp/en/service/finance/g_building/outline.html 24 DBJ Green Building Certification (Japanese) , Development Bank of Japan; http://www.dbj.jp/service/finance/g_building/outline.html 25 CASBEE, BASBEE; http://www.ibec.or.jp/CASBEE/english/ 26 Process of certification (Japanese) , DBJ Green Buildings; http://igb.jp/flow.html,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Activia Properties Inc.
