Sustainability Opportunities Through its two segments, Real Estate and Services, Swiss Prime Site (SPS) operates in the development, leasing and management of different real estate assets, with a focus on office and retail properties. Through some assisted living facilities, SPS contributes to the social infrastructure of Switzerland. There are no indications that the portfolio includes further real estate projects with a high social benefit (e.g. favorable leasing conditions for charit able organizations), or social housing. On the environmental side, 15% of total floorspace was certified to a green building standard such as LEED, DGNB or Minergie in 2019.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Is s ue r and Gre e n As s e t P ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 5 o f 1 9 Sustainability Risks The main social and environmental risks pertinent to real es tate companies include ensuring the health and safety of workers and tenants, climate protection, and managing and enhancing energy and resource efficiency of buildings. Swiss Prime Site (SPS) demonstrates initiatives to manage the health and safety of own employees and to provide for tenant and customer safety, yet does not demonstrate comprehensive strategies in this regard. Due to the company's operations in Switzerland only, exposure to these risks is however limited. In the context of climate change, S PS has developed a strategy including the compilation of relevant greenhouse gas emission inventories, risk assessments, planned measures, and the definition of a clear reduction target. A science - based target is not evident yet. To increase the energy eff iciency of its portfolio, the company has installed PV systems at some properties and aims to procure 100% of electricity from renewable sources. In addition, SPS refers to building shell renovations, and the implementation of LED lighting and efficient HV AC systems. Whether a large share of properties is already covered by these measures is not demonstrated. While further relevant topics such as green procurement of building materials or multi - modal transportation access and environmental awareness amongst tenants are named, there is no indication of comprehensive and clear strategies addressing these issues. Governance opinion Regarding Swiss Prime Site (SPS)' governance structure, majority of the board members is independent and separate predominantly ind ependent committees in charge of audit, remuneration and nomination are set up (66%, 100% and 100% respectively). The board chair (Mr. Ton B ƺ chner as at April 7, 2020) is classified independent by the company. SPS discloses its remuneration policy for exe cutives as a whole and the CEO individually, sub - divided into relevant components. A sustainability board composed of board directors and managers has been set up. In terms of remuneration, clear ESG targets do not seem to be incorporated into executives' variable remuneration scheme. As far as business ethics is concerned, the company has established a code of conduct addressing important issues such as conflicts of interest, corruption, antitrust violation, and gifts and entertainment. Moreove r, to ensure fair business practices, the code, which is available in local languages, needs to be confirmed by employees. In addition, employees are provided with anonymous and confidential whistleblower channels. Breaches of international norms and ESG controversies The company is not facing any controversy .,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Is s ue r and Gre e n As s e t P ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 6 o f 1 9 PART I I : ALIGNMENT WITH THE GREEN BOND PRINCIPLES 1. Use of Proceeds The proceeds of SǁiƐƐ Pƌiŵe Siƚe͛Ɛ Green Bond issuance will be used to finance or re - finance , in whole or in part, new or e xisting sustainable projects or assets and operating expenditure with a clear and defined environmental or social benefit either for Green Label Developments Projects or for the CO 2 Reduction Pathway of the Investment Property Portfolio. These are described in the table below: ELIGIBLE GREEN CATEGORY DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE OF EXISTING ELIGIBLE SPS ASSETS Green buildings x Acquisition, construction or refurbishment of buildings which meet recognized standards (primary focus for Green Bond issue), including the following: o Minergie certification o SNBS o BREEAM (very good and above) o LEED (gold and above) x Current list of eligible properties (see framework annex). Climate action and CO2 emissions x The proceeds will only be used to finance projects that contribute to (1) reduction of overall energy use and / or (2) reduction of CO2- and GHG- emissions x An overall goal to operate the portfolio with [50%] of renewable energy and without CO2 emissions x Progress tracking of CO2 reduction pathway based on Swiss Prime Site Sustainability Report. Responsible consumption and production x Use of materials low in pollutants and renewable materials x Buildings with maintained of low energy consumption x Potential measurements include: o % of portfolio that uses 100% renewable energy o Primary energy consumption o CO2e caused by heating/hot water o Energy savings o Electricity (general/tenants) o CO2e caused by Electricity similarly x Whenever feasible, Swiss Prime Site pursues the rollout of PV facilities. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the Use of Proceeds description provided by Swiss Prime Site align s with the GBPs. The project categories are aligned with the issuer’s broader sustainability strategy. The financing of ne w green real estate development projects is also seen as an added value .,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Is s ue r and Gre e n As s e t P ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 7 o f 1 9 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection Projects financed and/or refinanced through the Green Bond proceeds are evaluated and selected based on compliance with the Green Bond Eligibility Expenditure Criteria and alignment with Swiss Prime Site ́s strategic sustainability objectives. Swiss Prime Site has establish ed a Green Bond Committee composed of members of the Group Executive Board working jointly with the management teams from each Group company and specific representatives from the operational units to define appropriate initiatives and met rics for measuring their achievement. The Committee will also oversee the Green Bond implementation of the allocation and selection process of the Eligible Sustainability Project Portfolio. In this way it will be possible to regularly determine the implem entation progress and whether any adjustments need to be made. All the proceeds of the Green Bond will be allocated to the selected Eligible Sustainability Project Portfolio in accordance with the respective eligible expenditure. Swiss Prime Site will ens ure that all selected Eligible Expenditure comply with official national and international environmental and social standards, local laws and regulations on a best effort basis. Swiss Prime Site will report yearly on its Group sustainability commitments al ong all six dimensions and, since 2016, these reports have been formulated in accordance with the internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. In this way, Swiss Prime Site provides all interested stakeholders with transparent, regular and reliable information about its sustainability endeavours. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the Pro cess for Evaluation and Project Selection description provided by Swiss Prime Site aligns with the GBPs . Various departments are involved in the p roject e valuation and s election p rocess thanks to the creation of a Green Bond Committee. 3. Management of Proceed s Swiss Prime Site intends to allocate the proceeds from the Green Bonds to an Eligible Green Project Portfoli o, selected in accordance with the use of proceeds criteria and evaluation and selection process presented above. To ensure proceeds are allocated in accordance to the Green Bond Framework, the issuer will track the receipt and use of proceeds to the exte nt feasible via its internal reporting systems, ensuring all Eligible Expenditures in the Green Bonds are appropriately identified. Swiss Prime Site will strive, over time, to achieve a level of allocation for the Eligible Green Project Portfolio which, af ter adjustments for intervening circumstances including, but not limited to, sales and repayments, matches or exceeds the balance of an amount equal to the net proceeds from its outstanding Green Bonds.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Is s ue r and Gre e n As s e t P ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 8 o f 1 9 In the case where a project no longer meets the elig ibility criteria, the funds will be reallocated to other eligible sustainable projects. Payment of principal and interest will be made from its general account and not be linked to the performance of the eligible green projects. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the Management of Proceeds description provided by Swiss Prime Site aligns with the GBPs . Tracking of proceeds is ensured through internal IT systems , while alternative investment s in case projects no longer meet the eligibility criteria are dis closed. Moreover, the issuer ensures the p ayment of principal and interest will be made from its general account and not be linked to the performance of the eligible green projects , which is seen as positive. 4. Reporting Swiss Prime Site will publish a monitoring report on an annual basis until full allocation. This will: x Provide an update of total amount of proceeds allocated to Eligible Projects and Assets x State the remaining balance of any unallocated funds x Describe the qualitative and where possible and feasible , quantitative, indicators of the ƉƌŽjecƚƐ͛ eŶǀiƌŽŶŵeŶƚaů iŵƉacƚ Each annual report will be reviewed by the Green Finance Committee, approved by the Chair and verified by an independent assurance pro vider in advance of publication. The report will follow where feasible, ICMA harmonized framework for impact reporting. In addition, Swiss Prime Site is committed at reporting impact metrics of its eligible Green Portfolio, in line with the annual environ ment KPI report. https://sps.swiss/fileadmin/user_upload/redakteure/gruppe/pdf/geschaeftsberichte/en/Sustainabili ty_K ey_Indicators_2019.pdf Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the Reporting description of Swiss Prime Site is aligned with the GBPs . The allocation reporting on an annual basis is aligned with best market practices, while it has developed a detailed and transparent environment KPI report for impact reporting. External review Swiss Prime Site will engage external independent accountants to review that the assets included in the Swiss Prime Site Bond Asset Portfolio meet the Swiss Prime Site Eligibility Cr iteria and are not invested in other assets. Further, independent accountants will be engaged to review that the aggregate amount in the Eligible Portfolio is equal to or greater than the aggregate amount raised by Swiss Prime Site Green Bonds.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Is s ue r and Gre e n As s e t P ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

C O M / E S G 1 7 o f 1 9 ANNEX 2 : Methodology ISS ESG Green KPIs The ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs serves as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality ʹ i.e. the social and environmental added value ʹ of the use of proceeds of Swiss Prime Site ͛Ɛ GƌeeŶ BŽŶd . It comprises firstly the definition of the use of proceeds category offering added social and/or environmental value, and secondly the specific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the a ssets can be clearly identified and described. The sustainability criteria are complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measurement of the sustainability performance of the assets and which can also be used for reporting. If a majori ty of assets fulfill the requirement of an indicator, this indicator is then assessed positively. Those indicators may be tailor - made to capture the context - specific environmental and social risks. To review the KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Feder ico Pezzolato (details below) who will send them directly to you. Asset evaluation methodology ISS ESG evaluates whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eligible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bond KPIs. All percentages refer to the amount of assets within one category (e.g. wind power). Additionally, ƚhe aƐƐeƐƐŵeŶƚ ͞ ŶŽ Žƌ ůiŵiƚed iŶfŽƌŵaƚiŽŶ iƐ aǀaiůabůe͟ eiƚheƌ iŶdicaƚeƐ ƚhaƚ ŶŽ iŶfŽƌŵaƚiŽŶ ǁaƐ made available to ISS ESG or that the information provided did not fulfil th e requirements of the ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs. The evaluation was carried out using information and documents provided to ISS ESG on a confidential basis by Swiss Prime Site (e.g. Due Diligence Reports). Further, national legislation and standards, dependi ng on the asset location, were drawn on to complement the information provided by the issuer. Assessment of the contribution and association to the SDG The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed in September 2015 by the United Nations and pr ovide a benchmark for key opportunities and challenges toward a more sustainable future . Using a proprietary method, ISS ESG identifies the extent to which Swiss Prime Site ͛Ɛ GƌeeŶ Bond contributes to related SDGs.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Sus tainabil ity Q ual ity of the Is s ue r and Gre e n As s e t P ool I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

As part of our Sustainable ( Green & Social) Bo nd Services, we provide support for companies and institutions issuing sustainable bonds, advise them on the selection of categories of projects to be financed and help them to define ambitious criteria. We assess alignment with external principles (e.g. the ICMA Green / Social Bond Principles ), analyse the sustainability quality of the assets and review the sustainability performance of the issuer themselves. Following these three steps, we draw up an independent SPO so that investors are as well informed as possible about the q uality of the bond / loan from a sustainability perspective .
