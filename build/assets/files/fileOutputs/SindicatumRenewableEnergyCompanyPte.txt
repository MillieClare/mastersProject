INTRODUCTION Sindicatum Renewable Energy Company Pte. Ltd. ( “SREC” or the “Company” ) is a growth - oriented renewable energy independent power producer that develops, owns, operates and acquires contracted renewable energy generation facilities in the high - growth emerging markets of South and Southeast Asia. SREC has developed a Green Bond Framework under which it intends to issue Green Bonds , using the proceeds to finance or re - fina nce clean power generation facilities . Proceeds may be directed towards , but not limited to, the following types of projects : - Solar projects - Wind projects - Waste to Energy projects - Bagasse - Cogeneration projects SREC has engaged Sus tainalytics to provide a second opinion on its Green Bond F ramework and the framework’s environmental credentials. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics requested and reviewed a broad set of documentation in order to understand the planned use of proceeds , as well as other aspects of the SREC’s Green Bond Framework. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and other non - public information. Following this engagement, some elements of SREC ’s Green Bond Framework were clarified to ensure an alignment with the leve l of disclosure expected by Green Bond Principles ( G BP) 2017 1 , as well as ASEAN Capital Markets Forum’s ASEAN Green Bond Standards (“AGBS”) 2 . This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion on SREC ’s Green Bond Framework and should be read in conjunction with that framework. 1 The Green Bond Principles 2017, dated 2 June 2017, issued by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA): https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/doc uments/Regulatory/Green - Bonds/SocialBondsBrochure - JUNE2017.pdf 2 The ACMF has developed the A SEAN Green Bond Standards based on the ICMA’s GBP as they are internationally accepted and widely used for the development of national green bond guidelines or sta ndards issued globally. ASEAN Green Bond Standards, dated November 2017, issued by the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF): http://www.theacmf.org/ACMF/upload/ASEAN_Green_Bond_S tandards,© Sustainalytics 2017 4 2. SUSTAINALYTICS’ OPIN ION Section 1 : Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the SREC Green Bond Framework Overall, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Sindicatum Renewable Energy Company Green Bond Framework is credible and transparent, and aligns with the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles (GBP) 2017 and ASEAN Green Bond Standards (AGBS) 2017 . Some key considerations of the f ramework include: • Renewable Energy is recognized by the 2017 GBP and AGBS as a project category with clear environmental impact. SREC’s investments in renewable energy will result in reduced CO 2 emissions and contribute to Sustainable Development Goal ( SDG ) 7, Target 2: “By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix . ” • SREC ’s disclosure and processes with respect to the management of proceeds, project selection and reporting are in line with market practices. • SREC has a framework to consistently manage environmental, health, safety and social (EHS&S) risks and implement systems across its operations and project sites. SREC’s risk process ensures that all eligible project s undergo a mandated or voluntary environ mental and social risk assessment . V oluntary assessments a re aligned with the Performance Standards on Environmental a nd Social Sustainability (2012) of the International Finance Corporation (IFC). 3 • Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the exclusions out lined in the SREC Green Bond Framework serve to mitigate some of the environmental or social risk associated with the eligibility criteria, helping to ensur e that the bond proceeds will have a net positive impact. Alignment with ICMA’s Green Bond Princi ples 201 7 and ACMF’s ASEAN Green Bond Standards 2017 Sustainalytics has determined that the Sindicatum Renewable Energy Company ’s Green Bond Framework aligns to the four pillars of the GBP and AGBS 2017 . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 2 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form . 3 http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/Topics_Ext_Content/IFC_External_Corporate_Site/Sustainability - At - IFC/Policies - Standards/Performance - Standards,© Sustainalytics 2017 5 Section 2 : Assessment of SREC ’s Environmental and Social Risk Strategy SREC has articulated clear sustainability commitments th r ough its policies and its corporate responsibility framework . The company follows an Environmental and Social Corporate Policy, where it commits to : • Conducting and carrying out all our operations in an environmentally and socially acceptable and sustainable manner with minimal residual or negative impact on the associated components , be it people, property or biodiversity; • Prioritizing risk management strategies with the objective of achieving an overall reduction of risk to human health and the environment, focusing on the prevention of irreversible and/or sign ificant impacts; • Ensur ing that the safeguarding of personnel and property is carried out in accordance with relevant human rights principles and in a manner that avoids or minimizes risk to the affected communities . 4 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that SREC’s commitments to assess and manage environmental and social risks go beyond a commitment to legal compliance. T he Company’s policies, procedures and protocols demonstrate it s commitment to manag e its projects or project companies in line with local s tatutory norms and benchmarked against the widely accepted IFC Performance Standards and associated IFC/World Bank Environmental, Health, and Safety ( EHS ) Guidelines. Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) studies based on the IFC Perform ance Standards cover a wide range of issues to address environmental and social risk s including : management of environmental and social impacts, community impacts , resource efficiency and pollution prevention, and labour conditions. These standards are rec ognized as best practice internationally . Moreover, Sustainalytics considers this level of due diligence particular ly importan t given SREC’s involvement in developing and emerging markets, where the environmental and social risks associated with such proje cts are greater. Given the integration of environmental and EHS&S concerns into its operations, its robust internal risk assessment process for renewable energy projects, development of processes to mitigate environmental and social risks in alignment wit h the IFC Performance Standards, and the lack of environmental and social controversies associated with the proposed eligible projects, Sustainalytics believes that SREC is well positioned to mitigate common environmental and social risks in emerging marke ts. 4 SREC Environmental and Social Corporate Policy document,© Sustainalytics 2017 6 Section 3 : Impact of Use of Proceeds As of 201 4, Asia accounted for 33% of all global emissions . 5 These emissions are increasing globally, and at a faster rate in Asia th an in other parts of the world . 6 In the wake of the COP21 in Paris, there is a global desire to reduce energy use, increase energy efficiency and implement innovative technologies to combat climate change. SREC’s Green Bond proceeds will be allocated to renewable energy projects including solar and wind power generation faciliti es, waste - to - energy projects and bagasse - cogeneration projects which the company currently operates , is developing, or is acquiring in South and Southeast Asia . 7 In addition to a number of operating solar projects in both India and the Phil ippines , SREC currently also operates a number of bagasse cogeneration plants 8 in India and landfill gas e nergy ( LFGE ) 9 electric generation facilities in Thailand. Both bagasse and LFGE ha ve a proven track record as a source of clean energy . The energy produced using bagasse helps highly energy intensive sugar mills to meet 100% of their energy needs . Additionally, facilities needed to generate heat and electricity from bagasse are often located at or near the sugar mill , which removes the need for transportation . LFGE electric generation facilit ies utiliz e landfill gas for energy , which greatly reduces its climate change impact . 10 Furthermore, using landfill gas to produce electricity avoids the need to generate electricity at traditional power plants and thus reduces air pollution from these plants. The renewable energy projects to be financed by SREC’s Green Bond have a proven track record as a source of clean energy. Sustainalytics has a positive view of SREC’s project portfolio and believes such projects will reduce GHG emissions from electricity generation in high - growth emerging markets of South and Southeast Asia . Moreover, such projects will directly cont ribute to commitments made by each country to reduce GHG emissions. Alignment with the Sust a inable Development Goals ( SDGs ) The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) , spearheaded by the United Nations, were established in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. SREC ’s Green Bond s will specifically contribute to SDG 7, T arget 2: “By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable ene rgy in the global energy mix . ” 5 http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2016/05/03/asia - help - lead - way - change - course - climate - change 6 https://www.epa.gov/climate - indicators/climate - change - indicators - global - greenhouse - gas - emissions# 7 Current countries in which SREC has invested in include: India, Philippines, and Thailand. 8 Bagasse is the dry pulpy residue rem aining after the extraction of juice from sugar cane. It is a waste material (biomass) from sugar production. 9 L FGE is a system in which landfill gas is extracted through a network of pipes laid in the sanitary landfill , treated and used to generate elect ricity. 10 https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/lfg.pdf,© Sustainalytics 2017 7 Conc lusion Sustainalytics is of the opinion that SREC’s investments will result in reduced carbon emissions in South and Southeast Asian countries. Renewable energy is recognized by the GBP as an eligible green project category, offering clear environmental be nefits. Furthermore, t he Sindicatum Green B ond Framework is align ed with the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 201 7 (see Appendix 1 ) and ASEAN Green Bond Standards 2017 , which address use of proceeds , process for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds, and reporting. Based on the above considerations, Sustainalytics is of the view that the Sindicatum Green B ond Framework is robust and credible.,© Sustainalytics 2017 8 APPENDICES Appendix 1 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form Green Bond / Green Bond Programme External Review Form Section 1.
