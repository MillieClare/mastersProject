(Seibu HD) is a holding company that oversees Seibu Group, and was established in February 2006 after the reorganization of the Group. Seibu Group has Seibu Railway Co., Ltd. (Seibu Railway) and Prince Hotel Inc. (Prince Hotel) as core subsidiaries. The Group is engaged in urban transportation and railway operations centered on Seibu Railway in the northwestern part of Tokyo Metropolis and the western part of Saitama Prefecture. Seibu Group is engaged in hotel and leisure operations centered on the Prince Hotel, which is one of the largest hotel chains in Japan. Seibu Group is also engaged in real estate operations centering on rental facilities in the central Tokyo area and along-line stations. Seibu Group, including Seibu HD, established its Group Vision in 2006, aiming to respond to sustainable social development issues through a wide range of businesses and services, and to grow strongly with society. Seibu,2/14 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en Group calls environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities "sustainability actions," and is working to achieve sustainable growth throughout the Group. Based on consideration of various issues Japanese society confronting today as well as its shifting market environment, the Group has established 12 key objectives under four broad categories; customer safety, environmental conservation, community engagement and corporate culture. Seibu Group is actively pursuing initiatives in line with the key objectives. The scope of evaluation is the corporate bonds to be issued by Seibu HD. The proceeds of the bonds will be used for the refinancing of funds for purchasing trains that consume less electric power than conventional ones procured by Seibu Railway (Series 001 "Laview" and Series 40000) and the refinancing of funds for constructing solar power generation facilities. The introduction of new trains will reduce energy consumption by about 60% compared with conventional trains, and CO 2 emission reduction per train is expected to be about 1,010 tons in Laview and about 780 tons in Series 40000. The solar power generation facilities are expected to reduce energy consumption by about 4,000 t-CO 2 per year. As a result, all of these projects contribute significantly to CO 2 reduction. Seibu HD investigated and analyzed the possible negative impacts of the use of proceeds on the environment, and JCR confirmed that necessary measures are taken. As a result, JCR evaluates that these green projects do not have serious negative impacts that exceed the effect of environmental improvements on the environment and contributes to reduce CO 2 emissions. On the management, operation and transparency, JCR confirmed that Seibu HD has established the management and operation system for the green projects, that the selection criteria and the internal control system for the management of proceeds have been appropriately established, that prior disclosures to investors and post-issuance reporting have been appropriately planned, and that Seibu HD's management has positioned environmental issues as a priority issue with a high level of importance. Based on the JCR Green Finance Evaluation Methodologies, JCR assigns "g1" for the preliminary evaluation of the "Greenness (Use of Proceeds)" and "m1" for the preliminary evaluation of the "Management, Operation and Transparency". Consequently, JCR assigns "Green1" for overall preliminary evaluation. A detailed evaluation result is described in the next chapter. The Bonds are considered to meet the standards for items required by the Green Bond Principles and the Green Bond Guidelines of The Ministry of Environment of Japan. 12 1 ICMA(International Capital Market Association) Green Bond Principles 2018 https://www.icmagroup.org/green-social-and-sustainability-bonds/green-bond-principles-gbp/ 2 Ministry of the Environment Green Bond Guideline 2017 http://greenbondplatform.env.go.jp/pdf/greenbond_guideline2017.pdf,3/14 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en Chapter 2: Current Status of the project on each evaluation factor and JCR's evaluations Evaluation Phase 1: Greenness Evaluation JCR assigns "g1", the highest grade, to "Evaluation Phase 1: Greenness Evaluation". Rationale: 100% use of proceeds of the bond will be allocated to a green project, considering the factors described below. (1) JCR's key consideration in this factor In this section, JCR confirms whether the proceeds are used for green projects that have a clear environmental improvement effect. Next, JCR confirms whether an internal department/division which is exclusively in charge of environment issues or a third party agency prove it sufficiently and have taken necessarily workaround or mitigation measures, if there are any possibilities that the use of proceeds has negative impact on the environment. Finally, JCR confirms consistency with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). (2) Current status of evaluation targets and JCR evaluation Overview of Use of Proceeds The use of proceeds are to refinance the costs to purchasing trains that can operate with less power consumption than conventional ones procured by Seibu Railway and to refinance funds for the construction of solar power generation facilities operated by Seibu Railway. 1. Series 001 new express trains "Laview", 2. Series 40000 new commuter trains 3. Seibu Takeyama Solar Power Station a. On the environmental improvement effects of the project i. 100% of the funds will be appropriated for the refinancing of new procurement costs for rolling stock consuming less electricity than conventional one and for the refinancing of funds for the construction of solar power plants operated by Seibu Railway, and CO 2 emission reductions will be expected. The use of proceeds will be allocated for the new express train Series 001 nicknamed "Laview", which began operation in 2019, the new commuter train Series 40000, which began operation in 2017, and for the refurbishment of Seibu Takeyama Solar Power Station, which began commercial operation in February 2019. Use of Proceeds Equipment Allocation Ratio Introduction of new energy efficient Trains New express train Series 001 "Laview" New commuter train Series 40000 Approximately 70% Introduction of solar power generation facilities Seibu Takeyama Solar Power Station Approximately 30% Details of the environmental improvement effect of the project are as follows.,4/14 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en 1. Introduction of new energy-efficient Trains The new express trains Series 001 "Laview" (8 cars for one train) employ full-SiC (Silicon Carbide) elements that are resistant to heat, have low switching losses at the time of current on/off, and can be reduced in size and weight for a variable-frequency drive device that controls train acceleration and deceleration in environmental aspects. In addition, the adoption of a car body structure made of aluminum to make it lighter than before, the application of a heat insulating film to a window, the adoption of a regenerative brake in which a motor acts as a generator when a train brakes, and the generated electricity is returned to an overhead line and used as energy of another train which is in operation. As a result, the annual power consumption of "Laview" is reduced by about 60% compared with the Series 10000 "New Red Arrow" (7 cars for one train), which appeared in 1993, and the annual CO 2 consumption per train is expected to be reduced by about 1,010 tons. The new Series 40000 trains (10 cars for one train) employs a regenerative braking system, as well as a PMSM (Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor), which reduce power consumption during powering by individually controlling the motors with a single variable-frequency drive device and windowpane with thermal insulation performance. Series 40000 also employs the regenerative braking system. In addition, similar to the "Laview", the weight reduction of the car body structure is carried out by aluminum. As a result, the Series 40000 trains consumed approximately 60% less annually than the 2000 series trains (10- car trains), which appeared in 1977, and are expected to reduce CO 2 by approximately 780 tons annually per train. 2. Installation of solar power generation facilities According to the power generation forecast submitted by Seibu HD, the total annual average power generation of Seibu Takeyama Solar Power Station, which is the subject property, is 8,662 MWh, which is effective in reducing the annual average 4,002 t-CO 2 . ■ Solar power generation Project Location Power output (kW)(*) Annual Power Generation (Estimated) (Average 20 year)(MWh) Annual CO 2 Reduction(**) Seibu Takeyama Solar Power Station Yokosuka, Kanagawa 8,390 8,662 4,002 * : Indicates the amount of power on an output size basis. ** : Calculating CO 2 reductions = Estimated annual power generation × Adjusted emission factor (FY2017 (latest number)) Adjusted emission factors are published by the Ministry of the Environment by electric utility and by fiscal year. ii. Among the green projects defined in the Green Bond Principles or the Ministry of the Environment's Green Bond Guidelines, funds are used for "clean transportation", "clean transportation business", and "renewable energy". b. Negative impact on the environment In selecting the project, Seibu HD examined the negative impact on the environment and take mitigation measures as necessary. The environmental and social risks assumed for this green project are as follows. (1) Introduction of new energy-efficient trains Inappropriate use and management of hazardous substances in train manufacturing,5/14 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en Noise, vibration and ground subsidence caused by train operation Inappropriate management of hazardous materials generated from end-of-life trains (2)Installation of solar power generation facilities Concerns about sediment disasters associated with power plant development Damage of solar power generation facilities Seibu HD and Seibu Railway have confirmed that these environmental risks are not expected in train manufacturing. JCR also confirmed that the possibility of risks from natural disasters has been reduced by observing relevant laws and regulations and conducting necessary surveys such as environmental assessments for solar power generation facilities, and that the facilities have been covered by insurance in preparation for damage. When installing solar power generation facilities, Seibu Railway have sufficient communication with local governments, local residents, and related companies, and JCR confirmed that there are no specific problems on the project. JCR evaluates that Seibu HD is identifying possible risks and taking necessary countermeasures. c. Consistency with SDGs In the project, the introduction of energy-efficient trains is classified into "clean transportation" exemplified by the Green Bond Principles, "clean transportation business" exemplified by the Green Bond Guidelines of the Ministry of the Environment, and "renewable energy" by the introduction of solar power generation facilities, and JCR evaluates that these green projects will contribute to the following SDGs objectives and targets, while referring to the SDGs mappings of ICMA.

Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries,7/14 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en Evaluation Phase 2: Management, Operation and Transparency Evaluation JCR assigns "m1", the highest rating on JCR Evaluation Phase 2: Management, Operation and Transparency Evaluation. Rationale: These projects will be allocated the funding and implemented the businesses as planned through a firmly equipped management and operation system and high transparency as described below. 1. Appropriateness and Transparency concerning selection standard and processes of the use of proceeds (1) JCR's key consideration in this factor In this section, JCR confirms that the objectives to be achieved through the Bonds, the criteria for selecting green projects, the appropriateness of the process and the processes are appropriately disclosed to investors (2) Current status of evaluation targets and JCR evaluation a. Goal In 2006, Seibu Group, to which Seibu HD belongs, established a "Group Vision" consisting of "Group Philosophy," "Group Declaration," and "Slogan," and announced the Group's attitude toward which it is to aim. Of these, the Group declaration states that its environmental goals are "Mindful of the natural and global environment." in the Group Declaration "2. Walk together". Seibu Group calls ESG (Environment, Society and Governance) activities as "sustainability actions." Seibu Group has set four categories (customer safety, environmental conservation, community engagement, and corporate culture) and 12 agendas, which should be addressed in particular, in conducting "sustainability actions," and has been actively engaged in these activities. Of the 12 agendas, the environmental agendas are as follows: - Greenhouse gas reduction - Waste reduction - Ensuring water supply - Protecting forest and species The environmental goals to be achieved through this green bond are "Greenhouse gas reduction" in the agenda. JCR evaluates that the introduction of new energy-efficient trains contributes to the reduction of CO 2 emissions by reducing the amount of electricity consumption compared to conventional trains, and that the installation of solar power generation facilities directly contributes to the reduction of CO 2 emissions. JCR evaluates that the projects which is the use of proceeds of the bonds are consistent with the agenda aimed at the environmental impact reduction and are also consistent with environmental targets. b. Selection standard The eligibility criteria established by Seibu HD are projects in which negative impacts on the environment and society are appropriately avoided in accordance with compliance, and projects which have environmental improvement effects, and whose effects can be quantitatively measured. JCR evaluates that the eligible criteria set by Seibu HD are appropriate.,8/14 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en c. Processes The Finance Department of Seibu HD discusses the eligible criteria and approved by the executive officer in charge of the Finance Department after consultation with the President's Office, which is the department in charge of group sustainability actions. The Finance Department discuss internally if the project is in line with the eligible criteria. After that, the Finance Department evaluates and makes decisions whether the project should take into action or not in consultation to the President's Office. Regarding the project selection process, the Finance Department collects eligible projects based on the eligibility criteria and evaluates whether the projects meet the eligibility criteria. Then, in consultation with the President's Office, they select the candidate projects. The selected project is approved after thoroughly analyzed and examined by the executive officer in charge of the Finance Department, and the results of the selection are reported to Seibu HD Management Committee and Board of Directors. JCR evaluates that management is properly involved in the process in terms of funding selection criteria, the selection of green eligible projects, and the issuance of green bonds. These goals, selection standard and processes are to be disclosed to investors in accordance with their shelf registration supplements and JCR's evaluation report. JCR evaluate that the transparency to investors is ensured.,9/14 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en 2 . Appropriateness and Transparency of Management of the Proceeds (1) JCR's key consideration in this factor Management of the funding money varies with the issuer. In this section, JCR assesses whether the proceeds firmly allocated to the green project, the projects have internal systems to easily track the allocation of the proceeds and the money funded by the issuing the green bond will be allocated to the green bond at once. JCR also considers the evaluation of asset management of any unallocated money. (2) Current status of evaluation targets and JCR evaluation a. The proceeds will be allocated promptly in full to the refinancing of the eligible assets and will not be allocated for any other purpose. b. Seibu HD will provide loans to Seibu Railway, a subsidiary that is the subject of the project. Seibu Railway will manage the amount and timing of payments related to the project based on data registered in the company's accounting system, and applies for loans to Seibu HD with the approval of the head of the Finance Department. Seibu HD and Seibu Railway each manage the appropriation of funds, and Seibu HD reports to the executive officer in charge of the Finance Department. c. Seibu Railway will manage the total expenditure for the use of funds through its system, and will be audited by the Internal Control Department for each fiscal year. d. Procurement funds are managed in cash or cash equivalents until they are appropriated. If unappropriated funds arise due to the sale or damage of the target assets prior to redemption of the Green Bond, they will be managed in cash or cash equivalents until they are fully reapplied to projects that meet other eligibility criteria. JCR evaluates that Seibu HD's fund management is appropriate and that disclosure to investors is sufficient.,10/14 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en 3 . Reporting (1) JCR's key consideration in this factor In this Section, JCR evaluates whether the disclosure system for investors, etc. before and after the issuance of green bonds is planned in a detailed and effective manner at the time of the issuance of green bonds. (2) Current status of evaluation targets and JCR evaluation a. Reporting on the proceeds allocation The proceeds of the bonds will be promptly fully appropriated to the refinancing of the two projects. If the target assets are sold before the green bond is redeemed and in case that reapportionment is necessary, Seibu HD will disclose the total amount of the procurement fund appropriated to the sold assets on their website annually until the total amount is appropriated to a project meet other eligible criteria. b. Reporting on environmental improvement effects Seibu HD will disclose the environmental improvement effect annually on their website. Seibu HD plans to disclose following items Project KPI (Key Performance Indicators) Introduction of new energy-efficient trains Reductions in CO 2 emissions per km of transportation (gCO 2 per km) Installation of solar power generation facilities Power generation (actual power generation) annual CO 2 emissions reductions JCR evaluates the disclosure items and disclosure frequency as appropriate.,11/14 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en 4. Environmental Initiatives of the Organization (1) JCR's key consideration in this factor In this section, JCR evaluates whether issuer's management positions environmental issues as a high priority management issue, and whether the green bond policy, process and the criteria for selecting green projects are clearly defined through the establishment of a department specializing in the environmental field or through the assistance of external organizations. (2) Current status of evaluation targets and JCR evaluation Seibu Group, to which Seibu HD belongs, has established a Group Vision, which is composed of Group Philosophy, Group Declaration, and Group Slogan at the completion of the Group restructuring in 2006, and has expressed its stance as a group. Seibu Group Philosophy All of us at the Seibu Group work to help develop the local communities, as well as society at large, to protect the environment, and to provide safe, pleasant services for memorable experiences. We also proudly and responsibly meet the challenge of creating the kind of new services that will move customers. Seibu Group Declaration Our aim is to be professionals promoting customers' activities for rich experiences. 1. Be earnest Engage in all businesses and services with safety as their foundation.

Act as a member of our local community. Proactively cooperate with entities within and outside our group. 3. Meet challenges Act from a global perspective. Offer new services in anticipation of the coming times [new innovations]. Bring exciting new experiences to our customers' lives. Seibu Group Slogan Smiles Ahead Seibu HD and Group companies are actively tackling environmental issues based on the Group Vision. The Group Vision is distributed to group employees in the form of pamphlets and is shared by all members of Seibu Group as one to be addressed. Seibu Group's Medium-term Management Plan (2019-2021), which was announced in 2019, regards environmental issues as one of the most important issues in management, and announces that activities related to ESG will be called sustainability actions and will be promoted and strengthened. Seibu Group has systematically set up four areas and 12 agendas.,12/14 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en Seibu Group Sustainability Action Agenda (The Key Objectives) Customer safety Ensure safety and reliability Environmental conservation Greenhouse gas reduction Waste reduction Ensuring water supply Protecting forest and species Community engagement Invigoration of railroad corridor and local communities Universal design Aging population and low birthrate Corporate culture Work style reforms Recruiting diverse workforce Human resources development and Human resource management Compliance Seibu Group implements sustainability actions in line with the agenda. In particular, with regard to environmental initiatives, in order to reduce greenhouse gases, energy-efficient trains, such as the new express train "Laview" and the new commuter train Series 40000, as well as facilities, exemplified by regenerative power storage devices that store regenerative power generated during braking of trains, are being installed. In addition, renewable energy such as Seibu Takeyama Solar Power Station is being utilized. Regarding other environmental agenda, Prince Hotels is reducing, treating, and recycling food wastes and reusing wastewater and rainwater. Seibu Railway's Hanno-Seibu Forest has been actively engaged in and won the Superlative Stage, the highest level in the five-stage evaluation of the Social and Environmental contributions Green space Evaluation System (SEGES) in 2017. These initiatives have also been highly evaluated by third parties. In order to promote the sustainability action, Seibu HD, a holding company of Seibu Group, has the governance officer in the President's Office, which is directly connected to the management, to have the function of managing the sustainability action, to extract problems, set agendas. Seibu Railway, which actually carry out sustainability actions, departments with expert knowledge carry out actual business operations in cooperation with consulting companies with specialized knowledge on the external environment, as necessary. JCR confirms that when Seibu Railway acquired ISO14001, which is an internationally accepted standard for environmental management systems at the Musashioka Rolling stock Inspection Center, Seibu Railway cooperated with the outside specialist companies to conduct business. In issuing Green Bonds, the Finance Department collects projects based on the above agenda in collaboration with the President's Office, as described in "1.Appropriateness and Transparency concerning selection standard and processes of the use of proceeds", and the Finance Department evaluates whether the projects meet the above eligibility criteria. Then, in consultation with the President's Office, the candidate projects will be selected. The executive officers in charge of the Finance Department make a final decision after total analysis and examination. The results of the selection are reported to Seibu HD Management Committee and the Board of Directors. JCR evaluates the environmental initiatives of Seibu Group as a priority issue that management considers environmental issues to be of high importance.,13/14 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en ■Evaluation result Based on the JCR Green Bond Evaluation Methodology, JCR assigns "g1" for "preliminary Greenness Evaluation (Use of Proceeds)" and "m1" for "preliminary Management, Operation and Transparency Evaluation". Consequently, JCR assigns "Green1" as an overall preliminary evaluation results to the bonds. The bonds of the Company are considered to meet the standards for the items required by the Green Bond Principles and the Green Bond Guideline of the Ministry of the Environment of Japan.

Assumptions, Significance, and Limitations of JCR Green Bond Evaluation JCR Green Bond Evaluation, which is assigned and provided by Japan Credit Rating Agency (JCR), is a comprehensive expression of JCR's current opinion on the extent to which the proceeds of green bonds, which are subject to evaluation, are allocated to green projects defined by JCR and the extent to which the management, operation, and transparency of the use of green bonds are ensured. This does not perfectly disclose all the efforts taken by the issuer/borrower to ensure the use of proceeds, administration, management of the proceeds and the transparency. JCR Green Bond Evaluation is to evaluate the plan or status of the proceeds to green projects at the time of issuing green bonds or planning to issue, and does not guarantee the future actual allocation of the proceeds. JCR does not guarantee the positive environmental effects of green bonds nor is liable for their expected impacts. JCR confirms that the environmental impacts, which will be realized by the allocated proceeds, are calculated quantitatively and qualitatively by the issuer or by a third party requested by the issuer, but in principle JCR does not calculate them by itself. 2. Methodologies used in the conduct of this evaluation The methodology used in this evaluation are listed on JCR website (Sustainable Finance & ESG in https://www.jcr.co.jp/en)) as JCR Green Finance Evaluation Methodology. 3.
