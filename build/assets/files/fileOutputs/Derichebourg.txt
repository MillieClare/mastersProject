C O M / E S G 4 o f 1 8 ISS ESG ASSESSMENT SUMMARY 1 ISS ESG ’s evaluation is based on Derichebourg Green Bond Framework ( May 2021 version) and on the ISS ESG Corporate Rating applicable at the SPO delivery date (updated on the 2 5 .0 3 .2021). SPO SECTION SUMMARY EVALUATION 1 Part 1 : Green Bond link to issuer’s sustainability strategy According to the ISS ESG Corporate Rating published on 25 .0 3 .2021, the issuer shows a good sustainability performance against industry peer group on key ESG issues faced by the Metals Processing & Production sector. As of 10 .0 5 .2021, the company obtains a Decile Rank relative to industry group of 2 , given that a decile rank of 1 indicates highest relative ESG performance out of 10. The issuer ranks 10 th out of 67 companies within its sector. The Use of Proceeds financed through this bond are consistent with Derichebourg sustainability strategy and material ESG topics for the Metals Processing & Production sector . The rationale for issuing green bonds is clearly described by the issuer . Consistent with issuer’s sustainability strategy Part 2 : Alignment with GBPs Derichebourg has defined a formal concept for its Green Bonds regarding the Use of Proceeds , processes for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. This concept is in line with the Green Bond Principles . Aligned Part 3 : Sustainability quality of the Framework The overall sustainability quality of the Green Bond Framework in terms of sustainability benefits, risk avoidance and minimisation is good based upon the ISS ESG assessment . The Green Bond Framework will (re - )financ e eligible asset categories which include m aterial recovery from non - hazardous waste, collection and transportation of non - hazardous waste , recycling of end - of - life batteries, and m anufacture of secondary aluminium . Those U se of P roceed s categories have a positive contribution to SDGs 11 ‘ Sustainable Cities and Communities ’ , 12 ‘ Responsible Consumption & Production ’ and 13 ‘Climate action’. The environmental and social risks associated with those U se of P roceeds categories are well managed .

C O M / E S G 5 o f 1 8 ISS ESG SPO ASSESSMENT PART I : GREEN BOND LINK TO DERICHEBOURG ’ S SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY A. ASSESSMENT OF DERICHEBOURG ESG PERFORMANCE The ISS ESG Corporate Rating provides material and forward - looking environmental, social and governance (ESG) data and performance assessments. C O M P A N Y S E C T O R D E C I L E R A N K T R A N S P A R E N C Y DERICHEBOURG METALS PROCESSING & PRODUCTION 2 L E V E L VERY HI G H This means that the company currently shows a high sustainability performance against peers on key E SG issues faced by the ‘ Metals Processing & Production ’ Sector and obtains a Decile Rank relative to industry group of 2 , given that a decile rank of 1 indicates highest relative ESG performanc e out of 10. ESG performance As of 10 .0 5 .2021, this rating places Derichebourg 1 0 th out of 67 companies rated by ISS ESG in the ‘ Metals Processing & Production ’ sector . Key Challenges faced by companies in terms of sustainability management in this sector are displayed in the chart on the right, as well as the issuer’s performance against those key challenges in comparison to the average industry peers’ performance . Sustainability Opportunities Derichebourg offers metal waste collection, disposal, and recycling services to commercial and governmental customers. Its Environmental Services segment includes processing, recovery, and disposal of mostly ferrous and non - ferrous metal waste and end of life products and accounts for 66% of revenues in financial year 2020. The company’s second business segment, Multiservices, generated 34% of revenues and comprises various services such as cleaning, temporary work, energy, and outsources aeronautical services. Derichebourg’s recycling services provide clear envir onmental benefits as they contribute to increasing overall raw material use efficiency in the metals and electronics industries. The development of recycling solutions further promotes the transition towards a more sustainable circular economy.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f DE R IC HE B O UR G an d Gr e en Bon d Fra m e w ork E li gib il ity Cr it er ia I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 6 o f 1 8 Sustainab ility Risks As an operator of recycling centers, Derichebourg is exposed to risks related to occupational health and safety, energy use, and environmental impacts in own operations as well as in its supply chain. The company mainly operates in France with additional locations in Europe (Spain, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Portugal), the United States, Canada, Mexico, and China. In France, 51 % of sites are covered by a health and safety management system certified to OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001. However, no group - w ide health and safety management system seems to be established . Though Derichebourg’s occupational accident rate shows a decreasing trend, it is still comparatively high. Environmental risks and impacts of the company’s operations are addressed through va rious environmental programs and targets. Further, 59 % of industrial sites are certified according to ISO 14001 standards. However, relevant issues such as wastewater management, hazardous air emissions, facility safety and emergency response are not sufficiently addressed by Derichebourg. Being specialized in recycling services, the company is committed to promote circular metals production and has a strategic approach to promote recycling of scrap metals. While Derichebourg clearly acknowledges clima te change and has implemented various energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission reduction measures, a sound strategy remains to be developed. Derichebourg does not have clearly defined greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in place and energy and c arbon intensities have been increasing over the past three years which reflects a gap in the implementation of its efforts towards climate protection. To ensure business integrity, Derichebourg has developed a sound group - wide code of business ethics as we ll as a separate anti - corruption policy. These policies cover all relevant topics, including corruption, facilitation payments, gifts, insider trading and conflicts of interest. Some compliance measures such as training, risk assessments and a confidential whistleblowing channel are implemented. Governance Opinion Regarding Derichebourg’s governance, the company has a family shareholder structure. T he majority of board members, including the chair Daniel Derichebourg, are not considered to be independent , therefore the effective supervision of the executive management team cannot be ensured . At least partly independent board committees are established to oversee audit, nomination and remuneration (all as at February 5, 2021). Derichebourg discloses compens ation schemes of its executive officers, including long - term components, which could incentivize sustainable value creation. Governance of sustainability can be improved, as no independent board committee supervises the company’s sustainability strategy a nd ESG performance objectives do not seem to impact executive compensation. To ensure business integrity, Derichebourg has developed a sound groupwide code of business ethics as well as a separate anti - corruption policy. These policies cover all relevant t opics, including corruption, facilitation payments, gifts, insider trading and conflicts of interest. Some compliance measures such as training, risk assessments and a confidential whistleblowing channel are implemented. Sustainability impact of products a nd services portfolio Using a proprietary methodology, ISS ESG assessed the contribution of Derichebourg ’s current products and services portfolio to the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations (UN SDGs). This analysis is limited to the evaluation of final product characteristics and does not include practices along Derichebourg ’s production process.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f DE R IC HE B O UR G an d Gr e en Bon d Fra m e w ork E li gib il ity Cr it er ia I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

C O M / E S G 8 o f 1 8 B. CONSISTENCY OF GREEN BOND FRAMEWORK WITH DERICHEBOURG ’ SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY Key sustainability objectives and priorities defined by the issuer As Derichebourg’s core business, the Environment division provides waste processing and disposal – mainly metal waste – and of end - of - life products, with recovery of secondary raw materials using appropriate processing methods. With the increasing pressure s on scarce resources and a holistic focus on recycling and circularity, Derichebourg Environment provides French and global industries with energy - and resource - efficient solutions. Derichebourg is a member of the Bureau of International Recycling (BIR), the only global recycling industry association which brings together leading recycling companies and national federations from over 70 countries, representing directly or indirectly 30,000 companies. The federation provides a dynamic forum for its members to share their knowledge and experience and serves as a platform to establish successful business relations and to promote recycling among other industrial sectors and policy makers. The Group's consistent environmental strategy is based on measuring its greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts are being made both to reduce the impacts associated with its activities and to improve recycling performance. So far, Derichebourg’s total production of metals has helped to avoid the emission of 5.3 million t CO 2 e 2 . Deri chebourg intends to reduce its GHG emissions related to transport and production sites’ energy consumption. ISS ESG would recommend Derichebourg to introduce a broader strategy including the entirety of scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions . Rationale for issu ance The Green Bond Framework enables Derichebourg to raise finance in the form of green bonds, green project finance and any other types of financial instruments (the “Green Bonds”), the proceeds of which are allocated to eligible green projects as descri bed in the framework. The Green Bond Framework will finance activities that align with the overall Derichebourg sustainability strategy. Contribution of Use of Proceeds categories to sustainability objectives and priorities ISS ESG mapped the Use of Procee ds categories financed under this Green Bond Framework with the sustainability objectives defined by the issuer, and with the key ESG industry challenges as defined in the ISS ESG Corporate Rating methodology for the Metals Processing & Production sector . Key ESG industry challenges are key issues that are highly relevant for a respective industry to tackle when it comes to sustainability, e.g. climate change and energy efficiency in the buildings sector. From this mapping, ISS ESG derived a level o f contribution to the strategy of each Use of Proceeds categories. 2 More information is available on https://www.derichebourg.com/en/home/our - commitments/ambitious - environmental - commitments,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f DE R IC HE B O UR G an d Gr e en Bon d Fra m e w ork E li gib il ity Cr it er ia I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

The rationale for issuing G reen B onds is clearly described by Derichebourg .,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f DE R IC HE B O UR G an d Gr e en Bon d Fra m e w ork E li gib il ity Cr it er ia I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 0 o f 1 8 PART I I : ALIGNMENT WITH GREEN BOND PRINCIPLES 1. Use of Proceeds An amount equal to the net proceeds from the issuance of Green Bonds, will be used to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, new or existing projects that meet the Project Eligibility Criteria defin ed below (thereafter defined as “Eligible Projects”). When determining the eligible Use of Proceeds categories, Derichebourg has also considered the Technical Screening Criteria of the “EU Taxonomy” (April 2021 version). With the proceeds collected through its inaugural Green Bond, Derichebourg plans to acquire Ecore , a major player of the circular economy in Europe. ELIGIBLE CATEGORY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Eco - efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes Investments in or expenditures for the acquisitions, construction, refurbishment or maintenance of facilities/assets related to: • Material recovery from non - hazardous waste: mainly ferrous and non - ferrous metals, of whi ch more than 50% (in terms of weight) is processed and suitable for substitution of virgin materials in production processes • Separate collection and transportation of non - hazardous waste in source segregation fractions, enabling net GHG emission reductions through reuse and high - quality recycling of waste • Manufacture of secondary aluminium, producing significantly lower emissions than primary production • Recycling of end - of - life batteries Eligible Green Projects may include capital expenditures, operating expenditures related to improvement and extension of Eligible Green Projects, as well as acquisitions of ‘pure player’ 3 companies specialized in any of the above Green Bond Categories. Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Use of Procee ds description provided by Derichebourg’s Green Bond Framework as aligned with the Green Bond Principles . Ecore ’s acquisition and the activities that the company carries out are reflected in the Use of Proceeds categories of Derichebourg’s Framework. These categories set clear e nvironmental benefits that align with the ICMA principles . Moreover, the categories described show alignment with the sustainability strategy of Derich ebourg . 3 ‘ Pure player ’: A t least 90% of the revenue of the company (in this case, Ecore) acquired derives from activities falling in any of the above Green Bond C ategory .,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f DE R IC HE B O UR G an d Gr e en Bon d Fra m e w ork E li gib il ity Cr it er ia I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 1 o f 1 8 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection Derichebourg has established a dedicated internal Green Bond Committee to identify and select the Eligible Green Projects. The committee is formed of representatives from the following teams: Finance, S ustainability, Investor Relations, and Executive Management. The committee will be responsible for: • Reviewing, selecting and validating the Eligible Green Projects, under the Green Bond Framework • Verifying and providing annual reporting on allocation and impact of the net proceeds raised through the Green Bond • Monitoring the on - going evolution of the GBPs, particularly in relation to disclosure and reporting, to ensure Derichebourg activities are in line with best market practices The committee will meet on an annual basis, or more frequently as required, to review proposed allocations and ensure that these are in alignment with the Green Bond Framework. Opinion: ISS ESG considers the Process for Project Evaluation and Selection description provided by Derichebourg ’ s Green Bond Framework as aligned with the Green Bond Principles . The issuer has set a clear and detailed process including a variety of stakeholders. Dericheb ourg also established a Green Bond Committee responsible for the tracking of the proceeds, reflecting best market practices. The issuer has a process in place to identify ESG risks. 3. Management of Proceeds An amount equal to the net proceeds of the Green Bonds under the Framework will be managed and overseen by Derichebourg’s Finance function. Furthermore, the net proceeds will be wholly allocated to finance, refinance or invest in Eligible Projects as outli ned in the Green Bond Framework. The Finance team will ensure, on a best effort’s basis, that the portfolio of Eligible Projects exceeds, or at least is equal to, the amount of Green Bond proceeds raised under this Framework. Net proceeds from the issuanc e of Green Bonds can be used to refinance existing projects and expenditures, in accordance with the eligible green projects outlined in Derichebourg’s Green Bond Framework, with a lookback period of up to 36 months. For the inaugural Green Bond, Derichebo urg expects to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds within 12 months following the bond issuance. Pending full allocation, proceeds will be invested on a temporary basis, in accordance with relevant internal policies, in cash, cash equivalents or similar instruments. Opinion: ISS ESG finds that Management of Proceeds proposed by Derichebourg’s Green Bond Framework is well aligned with the Green Bond Principles . Moreover , Derichebourg has defined an expected allocation period of one year for the inaugural bond issued under this Framework . 4. Reporting Until the net proceeds are earmarked in full to Eligible Green Projects, and later in case of any material change in the list of Eligible Green Projects earmarked, Derichebourg will publish annually (i) an Allocation Report and (ii) an Impact Report, the latter subject to the availability of suitable information and data. The reports will be publicly available on Derichebourg’s website.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f DE R IC HE B O UR G an d Gr e en Bon d Fra m e w ork E li gib il ity Cr it er ia I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 2 o f 1 8 Allocation Report With the ai m of providing disclosure on the allocation of net proceeds, the Allocation Report will include: • Total amount of proceeds allocated to Eligible Green Projects, per category; • The proportion of the proceeds allocated to refinancing of existing Eligible Gree n Projects; and • The balance of unallocated proceeds invested in cash or cash equivalents Impact Report The Impact Report will provide information on the associated environmental impact metrics and outcomes of the green bond expenditures, subject to the av ailability of suitable information and data. Examples of Impact reporting metrics: • Total ferrous and non - ferrous metal waste processed (in metric tons) • Total secondary raw materials produced (in metric tons) • Recycling and recovery rates (%) • Energy savings from recycling materials (e.g. aluminium and steel) compared to their primary production (%) • Greenhouse gas emissions avoided from the use of secondary raw materials to produce new materials compared to production using raw materials (metric tons o f CO2 equivalent) Opinion: ISS ESG finds that the reporting proposed by Derichebourg ’ s Green Bond Framework is aligned with the Green Bond Principles . The issuer commits to annual ly report on allocation and impact in a clear, detailed and transparent manner. Furthermore, the issuer has defined a set of metrics to include in its impact reporting, in line with best market practices. External review An external auditor will be appoint ed to provide a “Limited Assurance” on the annual report, with regard to the use of net proceeds having been allocated in accordance with the Green Bond Framework. The auditor’s certification review will be published within the annual report.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f DE R IC HE B O UR G an d Gr e en Bon d Fra m e w ork E li gib il ity Cr it er ia I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S .

C O M / E S G 1 6 o f 1 8 ANNEX 1 : Methodology ISS ESG Green KPIs The ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs serve as a structure for evaluating the sustainability quality – i.e. the social and environmental added value – of the Use of Proceeds of Derichebourg ’ s Green Bond Framework . It comprises firstly the definition of the use of proceeds category offering a dded social and/or environmental value, and secondly the specific sustainability criteria by means of which this added value and therefore the sustainability performance of the assets can be clearly identified and described. The sustainability criteria ar e complemented by specific indicators, which enable quantitative measurement of the sustainability performance of the assets and which can also be used for reporting. If a majority of assets fulfill the requirement of an indicator, this indicator is then a ssessed positively. Those indicators may be tailor - made to capture the context - specific environmental and social risks. To review the KPIs used in this SPO, please contact Federico Pezzolato (details below) who will send them directly to you. Environmenta l and social risks assessment methodology ISS ESG evaluates whether the assets included in the asset pool match the eligible project category and criteria listed in the Green Bond KPIs . All percentages refer to the amount of assets within one category (e. g. wind power). Additionally, the assessment “no or limited information is available” either indicates that no information was made available to ISS ESG or that the information provided did not fulfil the requirements of the ISS ESG Green Bond KPIs . The ev aluation was carried out using information and documents provided to ISS ESG on a confidential basis by Derichebourg (e.g. Due Diligence Reports). Further, national legislation and standards, depending on the asset location, were drawn on to complement the information provided by the issuer. Assessment of the contribution and association to the SDG The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed in September 2015 by the United Nations and provide a benchmark for key opportunities and challenges toward a more sustainable future . Using a proprietary method, ISS ESG identifies the extent to which Derichebourg ’ s Green Bond Framework contributes to related SDGs.,S E C O N D P A R T Y O P I N I O N Su s ta in ab il ity Q u al ity o f DE R IC HE B O UR G an d Gr e en Bon d Fra m e w ork E li gib il ity Cr it er ia I S S C O R P O R A T E S O L U T I O N S . C O M / E S G 1 7 o f 1 8 ANNEX 2 : Quality management processes SCOPE Derichebourg commissioned ISS ESG to compile a Green Bond Framework SPO . The Second Party Opinion process includes verifying whether the Green Bond Framework aligns with the Green Bond Principles and to assess the sustainability credentials of its Green Bond Framework , as well as the issuer’s sustainability strategy.

The agency analyses companies and countries regarding their e nvironmental and social performance. As part of our Sustainable ( Green & Social) Bo nd Services, we provide support for companies and institutions issuing sustainable bonds, advise them on the selection of categories of projects to be financed and help the m to define ambitious criteria. We assess alignment with external principles (e.g. the ICMA Green / Social Bond Principles), analyse the sustainability quality of the assets and review the sustainability performance of the issuer themselves. Following these three steps, we draw up an independent SPO so that investors are as well informed as possible a bout the quality of the bond / loan from a sustainability perspective .
