EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF REVIEW and/or LINK TO FULL REVIEW (if applicable) It is expected that the majority of proceeds from Besqab’s Green Finance Framework will be allocated towards the category Green and Energy Efficient Buildings with criteria based on the Nordic Swan Ecolabel and Miljöbyggnad Silver, or Energy Performance Certificate A or B. Renovation leading to at least 30% impro vement in energy use is also eligible under this category. The other eligible category is Energy Efficiency. Initially the largest share of the proceeds under the framework will be for new financing. The look back period for re - financing will be up to two years. Besqab supports and will follow the national road map for climate neutral construction and shares the objective of being climate neutral by 2045. The road map stipulates that actors in the building and,Page 2 of 8 construction sector should measure their greenhouse gas (GHG ) emissions and decide on climate targets by 2022, have reduced their GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to 2015, and further reduced them by 75% by 2040. Meanwhile, Besqab has set as targets to ensure certification of all projects according to Nordic S wan Ecolabel or Miljöbyggnad Silver. Currently, Besqab does not report on greenhouse gas emissions. Besqab considers climate risks related to flooding and temperatures in the design phase or before a property is bought, and introduce mitigating actions acc ordingly. They do not, however, follow the TCFD recommendations and climate scenario analysis. Besqab’s policy towards sub - contractors largely follows from the Nordic Swan Ecolabel requirements. The requirements of this classification schemes applies to al l parties involved in the construction of the building. Based on the overall assessment of the eligibility criteria in the green finance framework, governance and transparency considerations, the framework receives an overall CICERO Medium Green shading . In order to achieve a Dark Green shading, the green finance framework would need stronger eligibility criteria in the Green and Energy Efficient Buildings category.,Page 3 of 8 Section 3. Detailed review Reviewers are encouraged to provide the information below to the extent possible and use the comment section to explain the scope of their review . 1. USE OF PROCEEDS Overall comment on section (if applicable) : An amount equivalent to the net proceeds from Besqab’s green finance instruments shall be used to finance or re - finance, in part or in full, eligible assets providing distinct environmental benefits (“Green Eligible Assets”). The criteria for eligibility covers the categories Green and energy efficient build ings and Energy efficiency. The issuer informs us that initially the largest share of the proceeds will be for new financing in the Green and Energy Efficient Buildings category. The look back period will be up to two years. Later, re - financing of nursing homes may become relevant. Green eligible assets can be owned by Besqab or by any if its subsidiaries or joint ventures. For the latter mentioned, the value of green eligible assets is to be adjusted for the share of capital owned by Besqab. The proceeds of Besqab’s green finance instruments will not be used to finance either fossil fuel energy generation, nuclear energy generation, weapons and defence industries nor potentially environmentally negative resource extraction, gambling or tobacco. Besqab wil l follow the development of the green financing market and manage any future updates of the Green Finance Framework to reflect current and future market practices (e.g. relating to the EU taxonomy) and potential updates to the Green Bond Principles and Gre en Loan Principles. Use of proceeds categories as per GBP : ☐ Renewable energy ☒ Energy efficiency ☐ Pollution prevention and control ☐ Environmentally su stainable management of living natural resources and land use ☐ Terrestrial and aquatic b iodiversity conservation ☐ Clean transportation ☐ Sustainable water and wastewater management ☐ Climate change adaptation ☐ Eco - efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes ☒ Green buildings ☐ Unknown at issuance but currently expected to conform with GBP categories, or other eligible areas not yet stated in GBPs ☐ Other (please specify) : If applicable please specify the environmental taxonomy, if other than GBPs: 2. PROCESS FOR PROJECT EVALUATION AND SELECTION Overall comment on section (if applicable) : According to the issuer, Besqab will continuously exercise its professional judgement, discretion and sustainability expertise when identifying the eligible assets. The selection of eligible assets is managed by a,Page 4 of 8 dedicated group, the Green Finance Committee (“GFC”). Members of the GFC consist of the CEO, CFO and Technical Manager. The Technical Manager holds the sustainability expertise as of now, and going forward Besqab will assure that the sustainability expertise always relies within the GFC. All decisions are made in consensus, and this applies to the selection process of eligible assets as well. The selection decisions are independently reviewed once a year by an external expert. A list of eligible assets is kept by the Finance Department who is also responsible for keeping it up t o date.,Page 5 of 8 Evaluation and selection ☒ Credentials on the issuer’s environmental sustainability objectives ☒ Documented process to determine that projects fit within defined categories ☒ Defined and transparent criteria for projects eligible for Green Bond proceeds ☒ Documented process to identify and manage potential ESG risks associated with the project ☒ Summary criteria for project evaluation and selection publicly available ☐ Other (please specify): Information on Responsibilities and Accountability ☒ Evaluation / Selection criteria subject to external advice or verification ☐ In - house assessment ☐ Other (please specify) : 3. MANAGEMENT OF PROCEEDS Overall comment on section (if applicable) : CICERO Green finds the management of proceeds of Besqab to be in accordance with the 2018 Green Bond Principles and Green Loan Principles. The list of eligible assets is monitored on a regular basis during the t erm of the green finance instruments to ensure that the proceeds are sufficiently allocated to eligible assets. This is also a responsibility of the GFC. Equivalent to the net proceeds from Besqab’s green finance instruments will be tracked by using a spre adsheet where all issued amounts of green finance instruments will be inserted. The spreadsheet will contain the list of eligible assets. Information available in the spreadsheet will in turn serve as basis for regular reporting. All green finance instrum ents issued by Besqab will be managed on a portfolio level. This means that a green finance instrument will not be linked directly to one (or more) pre - determined eligible assets. Besqab will keep track and ensure there are satisfactory eligible assets in the portfolio. Assets can, whenever needed, be removed or added to/from the eligible assets’ portfolio. Any unallocated proceeds will be temporary held by Besqab and placed on the company’s ordinary bank account. Tracking of proceeds: ☒ Green Bond proceeds segregated or tracked by the issuer in an appropriate manner ☒ Disclosure of intended types of temporary investment instruments for unallocated proceeds ☐ Other (please specify) : Additional disclosure: ☐ Allocations to future investments only ☒ Allocations to both existing and future investments ☐ Allocation to individual disbursements ☒ Allocation to a portfolio of disbursements ☒ Disclosure of portfolio balance of unallocated proceeds ☐ Other (please specify) :,Page 6 of 8 4. REPORTING Overall comment on section (if applicable) : To be fully transparent towards investors and other stakeholders, Besqab commits to regular reporting until no green finance instruments are outstanding. The Finance Department will be responsible for the reporting. The report will be published on the company’s website (https://investors.besqab.se) on an annual basis, with the first report expected in the spring of 2022. The allocation of proceeds reporting will be on a portfolio basis and will not be linked to an individual green finance instrument. The reporting will show total amount of green finance instruments issued, the share of proceeds used for financing/re - financing and share of proceeds used for the eligible categories, and share of unallocated proceeds (if any). Allocation of proceeds will be subject to an annual review by an external part/verifier. The verification report provided by the external part will be published on Besqab’s website. The impact reporting will also be on a portfolio basis. Besqab intends to report on quantitative impact indicators where reasonable and where relevant data is available for the two main categories: Green and energy efficient buildings: • Information on the energy usage in kWh/m2/year • Estimated annual greenhouse gas emissions reduced or avoided (tCO2e/year) • Energy performance certificate class, if any • Type of certification including level, if any (e.g. Nordic Swan Ecolabel, Milj ö byggnad Silver, etc.) Energy efficiency: • Amount of energy saved per m2. • Estimate d annual greenhouse gas emissions reduced or avoided (tCO2e/year) In estimating impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, the grid factor for the Nordic mix will be used. The method will be made publicly available.

Second Party Opinion : An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as informatio n barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issu er’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. 2. Verification: An issuer can obtain independe nt verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the en vironmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceed s, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. 3. Certification : An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external gr een standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. 4. Green Bond Scoring/Rating : An i ssuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless ref lect material environmental risks.
