1/12 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en/ 19-D-0594 September 18, 2019 Green Finance Fra mework Evaluation b y Japan Credit Rating Agenc y, Ltd. Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. (JCR) announces the following Green Finance Framework Evaluation Results. JCR assigned Green 1 (F) to the Green Finance Framework By Vena Energy Subject : Green Finance Framework of Vena Energy <Green Finance Framework Evaluation Results> Overall evaluation Green 1(F) Greenness Evaluation (use of proceeds) g1(F) Management, Operation and Transparency Evaluation m1(F) Chapter 1: Evaluation Overview Vena Energy, headquartered in Singapore, is a corporation that invests in project companies engaged in solar and wind energy generation projects in the Asia-Pacific region. Vena Energy Group and its project companies, is a leading renewable Independent Power Producer in the Asia-Pacific region with total consolidated assets of US$5.6 billion at the end of 2018. Since its establishment in 2012, Vena Energy has been active in the solar and wind power generation business across the Asia-Pacific regions. As of end 2018, the company possesses solar and wind power assets in seven countries with an aggregate capacity of over 2GW through its project companies. Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), one of the world's leading independent infrastructure investment funds, acquired Vena Energy's predecessor, Equis Energy, in 2018. GIP then renamed the company Vena Energy and became its main sponsor. For the acquisition, GIP formed a consortium with Public Sector Pension Investments (PSP), one of Canada’s largest pension funds, and China Investment Corporation (CIC), China’s sovereign wealth fund. The details of the consortium's stake are undisclosed, but the majority is owned by GIP. Vena Energy Group is one of GIP’s largest single investments to-date and is of high importance to GIP's infrastructure investment strategy. The subject of the evaluation is the Green Finance Framework established by Vena Energy in order to specify the use of proceeds funded by bonds or loans to the projects that have environmental benefits. JCR evaluates whether the,2/12 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en/ framework is in line with the Green Bond Principles (2018 edition), the Green Bond Guidelines (2017 edition) and the Green Loan Principles. 1 In Vena Energy's Green Finance Framework (the Framework), the funds procured through green bonds or green loans are used for 1. Solar energy related projects, 2. Wind energy related projects, and 3. Hydropower related projects (new construction of less than 15MW of small-scale hydropower or re-powering of existing large-scale hydropower of more than 20MW). JCR evaluates the use of proceeds to be renewable energy projects that contributes to decarbonization and contribute to environmental improvement. With regard to possible negative environmental and social impacts of the construction and operation of the above-mentioned power generation facilities, it is highly unlikely that the negative impacts will exceed the environmental improvements, as Vena Energy has established a system to minimize the possibility of negative impacts by conducting necessary risk assessment and mitigation in accordance with IFC Performance Standards 2 and other international standards, such as ILO Basic Terms and Conditions of Work. Under its Green Finance Framework, Vena Energy committed the following management and operation system; (1) a Sustainability Committee to oversee the selection criteria, selection process and reporting of green projects; (2) a dedicated bank account for green funds and; (3) a commitment to disclose its allocation status annually by country, by asset and Key Performance Indicators (KPI) of the environmental impacts of the green investment. Consequently, JCR confirms that Vena Energy has a robust administrative and operational system and is highly transparent with respect to Green finance. As a result, JCR assigns "g1 (F)" for "Greenness Evaluation (Use of Proceeds)" and "m1 (F)" for "Management, Operation and Transparency Evaluation". Consequently, JCR assigns "Green1 (F)" as an overall evaluation results to the Framework. Detailed evaluation results are discussed in the next chapter. JCR has also evaluated and concluded that the framework meets the standards for the Green Bond Principles, the Green Bond Guidelines of the Ministry of the Environment of Japan, and the Green Loan Principles. 1 The Green Bond Principles, the Green Bond Guidelines and the Green Loan Principles are not binding as they are voluntarily published and regulated by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA), the Japanese Ministry of the Environment, the Loan Market Association (LMA) and the Asia-Pacific Loan Market Association (APLMA), respectively, but are assessed by reference to these Principles and Guidelines as currently globally unified standards. 2 IFC Performance Standard (2012 Edition) is one of the key environmental and social risk-management standards. This is for private sectors to commit to ensure sustainable business activities, set by International Finance Corporation.,3/12 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en/ Chapter 2: Current status of the project on each evaluation factor and JCR's evaluations Evaluation Phase 1: Greenness Evaluation JCR assigns "g1 (F)", the highest grade, to "Evaluation phase 1: Greenness Evaluation". Rationale: 100% use of proceeds under the Framework will be allocated to a green project, considering the factors described below. (1) JCR's key consideration in this factor In this section, JCR first assesses whether the Eligibility Criteria set out in the Framework are green projects with clear environmental improvement effects. Next, JCR assesses whether an internal department/division which is exclusively in charge of environmental issues or a third party agency confirms whether a green project has sufficiently taken necessary workaround or mitigation measures, in the event the use of proceeds has a negative impact on the environment. Finally, JCR confirms consistency with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). (2) Assessment Framework and JCR Evaluation <The Framework for Use of Proceeds> Vena Energy’s Green Finance Framework (the Framework) stipulates the use of procured funds as follows. Eligible Green Categories Use of proceeds Renewable Energy 1. Hydropower: run of river and small hydro (< 15MW (CDM defined))3 existing large hydro > 20MW in temperate zones, re- powering of existing large hydro system 2. Solar energy: photovoltaic solar electricity, concentrated solar power, infrastructure and manufacturing, transmission 3. Wind energy: offshore and onshore wind farms, infrastructure and manufacturing, transmission <Evaluation of JCR for this framework> a. On the environmental improvement effects of the project i. The eligibility criteria set out in the Framework for funding are renewable energy, which are highly effective in improving the environment. Vena Energy shall finance or refinance, in whole or in part, new or existing projects under development, construction and/or operation from any of the eligible project categories defined in its framework. Wind, solar, and hydro are clean energies that reduce CO 2 by replacing fossil fuels. The Paris Agreement, which came into force in November 2016, states that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions should be virtually zero in the second half of the century. In order to achieve progressive decarbonisation, it is essential to promote renewable energy sources such as wind power and solar power generation, which utilize natural renewable resources and does not emit Green House Gas (GHG) from power generation activity. The introduction of renewable energy has a high environmental improvement effect due to the minimal level of natural resource exploitation and easement of climate change risks. While hydropower projects require adequate consideration of potential material environmental and social risks, the industry has taken careful evaluation and the Climate Bond Initiative 4 includes 5 projects of small-scale hydropower and the maintenance and renovation of 3 Clean Development Plan (Clean Development Mechanism) stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol of the Framework Convention on Climate Change 4 Climate Bonds Initiative is an international NPO established in December 2010 to encourage large scale investment for decarbonized economy. CBS (Climate Bonds Standards) is a screening tool for investors or governments investment decisions. 5 https://www.climatebonds.net/files/files/cbi-green-climate-definitions-v1_2.xlsx,4/12 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en/ existing large-scale hydropower that meet other international standards as eligible green categories. Vena Energy defines its eligible project categories in accordance with the Climate Bonds Standards set by the Climate Bonds Initiative as eligible standards for renewable energy projects and follow any revision 6 of key best practices set by the industry. In order to appropriately avoid and mitigate adverse risks to the environment and society and conduct business operations with adequate environmental and social considerations, Vena Energy prepares an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and, as needed, implements Corrective Action and the Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) at each project cycle i.e. initial investment appraisal, due diligence, development, construction, and management. The Company has renewable energy projects in seven countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In order to efficiently carry out project development, Environmental Impact Assessment, ESMP and ESMS, including inhouse due diligence of each project, are implemented by local offices located in each project country. If there are any material issues related to the continuity of the projects are raised, it shall be reported to the head office based on guidance of Vena Energy’s Environmental and Social Responsibility Policy (ESR Policy). Vena Energy’s portfolio consists of 43 operational assets, 14 construction assets and 13 shovel ready assets as of 31 December 2018. All construction and shovel ready assets are scheduled to be completed in 2021 and 70 power assets will be in operation in total. The breakdown of Vena Energy's portfolio shows that solar and wind power plants account for 68% and 32%, respectively based on 2018 EBITDA. By country, Japan and India's share of generation revenue was the highest in 2018 with 33% of the total respectively, followed by the Philippines with 22%, Thailand with 11%, and Taiwan with 1%. The power plants will be located in seven countries, including those projects scheduled for completion: Japan, India, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Australia. Vena Energy intends to expand its Asian portfolios, mainly in solar and wind power. ii. Uses of proceeds fall under the categories of "Renewable energy" among the green projects defined in the Green Bond Principles, Green Loan Principles or the Ministry of the Environment's Green Bond Guidelines. b. Negative impact on the environment Vena Energy conducts risk assessment and management of individual projects based on the following eight IFC Performance Standards in order to realize sustainable business activities. Performance Standard 1 Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts Performance Standard 2 Labor and Working Conditions Performance Standard 3 Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention Performance Standard 4 Community Health, Safety, Security Performance Standard 5 Land Acquisition and involuntary resettlement Performance Standard 6 Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources Performance Standard 7 Indigenous People Performance Standard 8 Cultural Heritage 6 For example, the Climate Bond Initiative has circulated the revised draft for public consultation and is scheduled to publish in 2019.,5/12 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en/ The company also pays due consideration to the safety of workers and the environment, in accordance with the IFC Performance Standards and World Bank Group's Environmental, Health, Social Guidelines (EHS Guidelines). 7 Among these, waste disposal standards and emergency countermeasures such as typhoons are appropriately planned on a project by project basis. In addition, the company manages an Environmental and Social Responsibility Policy (ESR Policy) concerning risk assessment and management practices, in which the responsibilities of senior management and employees are clearly defined. As a result of its rigorous due diligence and thorough risk management processes, JCR has confirmed through hearings that there is no site where disputes or other serious problems have occurred in its project sites at the time of evaluation. c. Consistency with SDGs goals and targets This project is classified as "Renewable energy", and JCR evaluated these projects as contributing to the following SDGs targets based on the SDGs mappings of the ICMA. Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy Target 7.1. By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services Target 7.2. By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix Goal 13: Climate action Target 13.1. Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries. 7 Vena Energy takes measures to comply with general standards of cross industry issues, such as pollution management, HSE, community health and construction/decommissioning as well as industry specific standards of Wind Energy.,6/12 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en/ Evaluation Phase 2: Evaluation on Management, Operation and Transparency JCR assigns "m1 (F)", the highest rating on JCR evaluation Phase 2: Management, Operation and Transparency Evaluation. Rationale: These projects will receive funding and implement businesses as planned through a firmly equipped management and operation system with high transparency as described below. 1. Appropriateness and Transparency concerning selection standard and processes of the use of proceeds (1) JCR's key consideration in this factor In this section, JCR confirms that the objectives to be achieved through the green finance, the criteria for selecting green projects, the appropriateness of the process, and the series of processes are appropriately disclosed to investors. (2) Current status of evaluation targets and JCR evaluation a. Goal <The Framework for Green Finance Issuance Objectives> As a leading renewable energy developer in the Asia-Pacific region, Vena Energy aims to contribute to the conservation of the global environment. Since its establishment in 2012, it has incorporated the management of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards into its investment strategies to promote business activities. It recognizes that consideration for ESG is fundamental to the development, construction and management of all its projects. It operates in accordance with IFC Performance Standards, the World Bank Environmental and Social Standards, and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. b. Selection Criteria <The Framework for Selection Criteria and Process> Vena Energy referred to the CBI Eligibility Criteria when establishing its selection criteria. JCR considers it appropriate. Vena Energy tries to avoid, manage or minimize any possible adverse impacts on environment and society by using a check sheet based on the IFC Performance Standards, in an effort to avoid, manage and minimize potential negative impacts. Vena Energy established the Sustainability Committee to oversee and monitor the Green Finance Framework. The Committee consists of representatives from Operation Department, ESG/Sustainability Department, and the Treasury and Finance Department. Determining whether a project is eligible requires the unanimous approval of all three departments. The Investment Committee reviews whether the pre-selected projects comply with the ESG criteria. The Investment Committee pre-approves the selection of projects based on environmental impact assessments, financial models and due diligence. Consistent with this pre-screening, the finance department will support the financing decision based on Vena Energy’s routine funding process. Once the project has been approved by the Investment Committee, the Sustainability Committee checks whether the project complies with the framework and its eligibility criteria. After that, Sustainability Committee classifies them into eligible projects. The Sustainability Committee will validate the final selection of the project.,7/12 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en/ The projects that are financed by green bond or loans will be overseen by the Sustainability Committee to comply with the “Use of proceeds” provision. The Sustainability Committee will oversee the related reporting. <Evaluation of JCR for the Framework> JCR evaluates that Vena Energy has an effective internal control structure for setting the criteria and processes for selecting eligible green projects with the function of the Sustainability Committee launched this year. In addition to the Investment Committee, the Sustainability Committee oversees Green Finance-related businesses comprehensively and independently. JCR found that Vena Energy would ensure the transparency for investors, as it plans to disclose its green finance objectives, selection criteria, and processes at the time of bond issuance in the supplementary documents for shelf registration, and its green finance framework.,8/12 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en/ 2. Appropriateness and Transparency of management of the proceeds (1) JCR's key consideration in this factor It is generally assumed that the management method of the proceeds varies by issuer or borrower. JCR confirms whether proceeds procured through the issuance of green finance are appropriated to the green projects and whether a mechanism and internal system are in place to enable easy tracking and management of the appropriation of proceeds. JCR also attaches importance to evaluating the management and operation of the unallocated proceeds, as well as to confirming that the proceeds from the bonds are allocated to green projects at an early stage. (2) Current status of evaluation targets and JCR evaluation <The Framework for proceeds management> a Vena Energy will open and manage a dedicated Green Finance Account to deposit the Green Bonds or Green Loans. b Account balance will be tracked periodically until full allocation and earmarked for allocation in accordance with the Green Financing Framework. c Unallocated proceeds will be managed in cash or cash equivalents accounts by the Treasury Department until full allocation. d The net proceed of the green bonds/loans will be allocated for new financing or refinancing of eligible green projects. The look-back period for refinancing is set at 36 months. e Under the extraordinary scenario where an eligible project is divested, Vena Energy will either reinvest in a new Green Project or reduce the outstanding of the net green bonds/green loans in order to maintain the net balance of the account. f Green Finance Accounts are properly booked and kept until maturity. g The management of proceeds will be appropriately audited by a third party organization such as the SPO provider. <Evaluation of JCR for the Framework> Vena Energy clearly separate the funds procured by green bonds or green loans from other funds by preparing a separate account exclusively for the green bonds and green loans. JCR evaluates that this is a transparent management method, as it ensures the tracking of accounts using cash inflow and outflow records. The allocation of funds procured through green financing to the eligible assets is subject to audits by a third party and is appropriately managed. In addition, if any green projects are divested in an unexpected event, the fund management method is clearly stipulated, such as re-allocating funds to new green projects or maintaining a balance by reducing the outstanding amount of green bonds/loans. As a result, JCR evaluates the appropriateness and transparency of the management of proceeds as high.,9/12 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en/ 3. Reporting (1) JCR's key consideration in this factor In this section, JCR evaluates whether the disclosure system for investors before and after the issuance of green finance is planned in a detailed and effective manner at the time of the issuance of green finance. (2) Current status of evaluation targets and JCR evaluation <The Framework for Reporting System> (Allocation Report) The company plans to announce the following details on its website once a year until all funds procured through green bonds or green loans are fully allocated. It also plans to undergo an audit by a third party each year until full allocation. The allocation report will disclose information per asset type, comprising detailed examples, such as: Allocated amount per asset category (RE type) vs. total amount (in %) Geographic split per country Weighted average age of the project being financed or refinanced by the Green Bond/Loan issuance with information related to the phase (construction vs operation) Total project size (MW) per asset category Total annual operating hours Example of projects financed by the proceeds, including their description (date, location, category, progress) (Impact Report) The company will disclose the following KPI by asset class, until all proceeds from Green Bonds or Green Loans are fully allocated: Installed capacity (MW) Annual GHG emissions avoided in tons of CO2 equivalent (in tons of CO2) Annual renewable energy production (MWh) Number of Households powered <Evaluation of JCR for the Framework> JCR found it appropriate that a detailed allocation status is planned to be disclosed by each country and asset categories. Regarding the impact, in addition to the estimated capacity and power generation, the number of households benefiting from the supply of electricity is also scheduled to be announced. JCR evaluates these disclosures and their frequency as appropriate in light of the Green Bond Principles, the Green Loan Principles and the Green Bond Guidelines.,10/12 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en/ 4. Organization's environmental efforts (1) JCR's key consideration in this factor In this section, JCR evaluates whether the issuer's management positions environmental issues as a high priority management issue, and whether the green finance policy, process and the criteria for selecting green projects are clearly defined through the establishment of a department specializing in the environmental field or through the assistance of external organizations. (2) Current status of evaluation targets and JCR evaluation As a company specializing in the development and operation of renewable energy, Vena Energy has been expanding its business in the Asia-Pacific region, with contribution to the conservation of the global environment as an important management policy. Since its founding in 2012, Vena Energy has incorporated ESG considerations at every stage of its investment policy, business development, and asset management. In doing so, the Environmental and Social Responsibility Policy ("ESR Policy") is formulated in compliance with global standards such as the IFC Performance Standard and the World Bank Group's Environmental, Health, Social Guidelines, and the policies and procedures for actual operations are established. The ESR policy aims to achieve the following objectives. Comply with relevant laws and regulations Comply with the International Labour Standards of the ILO and the United Nations Global Declaration of Human Rights Use natural resources and environmental protection effectively to the greatest extent possible Reduce GHG emissions Assess impacts and provide effective measures for the surrounding community through business activities Maximize the positive impact of the project on the environment, employees and stakeholders, and minimize negative risks. In order to achieve the above objectives, Vena Energy adheres to an investment exclusion list and hires E&S consultants to assist risk assessment and plan and implement corrective actions as part of ESMP. Day to day environmental, safety and social operation is managed by each Country’s HSSE managers. In addition, a moderate, major or critical category event is notified immediately to senior managements across levels such as Group, Regional and Country, including Chief Risk Officer, HSSE Group Head and General Counsel. A description of the incident is sent to the Country Incident Report portal within 24 hours. A full report including an investigation and Root Cause & Corrective Action plan is submitted within 10 days to the CEO for assessment and direction of corrective actions. The ESR Policy also clearly defines the responsibilities (i.e. execution, monitoring and reporting) of senior management and employees in responding to environmental and social concerns and matters in green projects. From the above, JCR confirmed that Vena Energy’s management regards environmental issues as a high priority and that environmental and social considerations are being taken into account in the operation of each project under the leadership of each country office. JCR also confirmed that a variety of 3 rd party experts are used as necessary at each stage of the green finance procurement policy and process, as well as the selection, development, and management of green projects. Based on the above, JCR evaluates that in addition to the fact that its business activities themselves contribute to environmental conservation, the company has taken adequate measures to minimize possible risks of adverse impacts on the environment and society that may arise when conducting business.,11/12 https://www.jcr.co.jp/en/ ■ Evaluation result Based on JCR Green Finance Evaluation Method, JCR assigns "g1 (F)" for "Greenness Evaluation (Use of Proceeds)" and "m1 (F)" for " Management, Operation and Transparency Evaluation". Consequently, JCR assigns "Green1 (F)" as an overall evaluation. The Framework is considered to meet the standards for the items required by the Green Bond Principles, Green Loan Principle and the Green Bond Guideline of the Ministry of the Environment of Japan.

Assumptions, Significance, and Limitations of JCR Green Finance Framework Evaluation JCR Green Finance Framework Evaluation provided by Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. (JCR) evaluates the policies set forth in the Green Finance Framework, and presents JCR's overall opinion at this time on the suitability of the Green Project as defined by JCR and the extent of efforts to ensure management, operation, and transparency regarding the use of funds. Therefore, it is not intended to perform specific environmental improvement effects, management and operational systems, and transparency evaluations, etc. of the use of funds for individual bonds or borrowings, etc. implemented based on the said policy. In cases where green finance evaluations are granted for individual bonds or individual borrowings based on the framework, it is necessary to perform a separate evaluation. JCR Green Finance Framework Evaluation does not demonstrate the environmental improvement effects of individual bonds or borrowing implemented under this framework, and does not assume any responsibility for the environmental improvement effects. In principle, JCR does not directly measure the environmental improvement effects of funds procured under the Green Finance Framework, although JCR confirms matters that are quantitatively and qualitatively measured by the issuer or by a third party requested by the issuer. 2. Methods used in the conduct of this evaluation The methods used in this evaluation are listed on JCR website (Sustainable Finance & ESG in https://www.jcr.co.jp/en/)) as JCR Green Finance Evaluation Method. 3.
