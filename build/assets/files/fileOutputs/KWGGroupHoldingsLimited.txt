Business segments of KWG includes property development and management, serviced apartments, cultural tourism, education, healthcare, hotels across Chinese cities. As of December 2020, KWG presents over 40 Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Hong Kong , operating eight shopping malls while offering eight high - end office projects . KWG has developed the KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework (the “ F ramework ”) which is the guiding document for KWG’s future Green Financing Transactions ( “ GFT ” ) , including bonds, loans and other financing products where proceeds are used to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and future projects that improve the environmental performance of its properties . The F ramewo rk defines eligibility criteria in five areas: 1. Green Buildings 2. Energy Efficiency 3. Pollution Prevention and Control 4. Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management 5. Renewable Energy KWG engaged Sustainalytics to review the KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework , dated May 2021 , and provide a S econd - P arty O pinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) 1 and the Green Loan Principles 202 1 (GLP). 2 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 3 Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent 4 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • The Framework’s al ignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA and the Green Loan Principles 202 1 , as administered by LMA, APLMA and LSTA ; 5 • The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and • The alignment of the issuer ’ s su stainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1. 8 .1 , which is informed by market practice and Sustain alytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of KWG ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. KWG representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the s ole responsibility of KWG to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a time ly manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ . 2 The Green Loan Principles are administered by the Loan Market Association, Asia Pacific Loan Market Association and Loan Syndications & Trad ing Association and are available at https://www.lsta.org/conte nt/green - loan - principles/ 3 The KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework is available on KWG Group Holdings Limited’s website at: https://www.kwggroupholdings.com/en/ 4 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustainalytics and ensuring an alyst independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust co nflict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consistency of process, structural separation of commercial an d research (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, anal yst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparency. 5 In addition to the Loan Markets Association, the GLP is also administered by the Asia Pacific Loan Market Assoc iation and the Loan Syndications & Trading Association .,Second - Party Opinion KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework 3 This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. Any update of the present Second - Party Opin ion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and KWG . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants an y alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The m easurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the intended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee the real ised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or argument , either in favour or against, t he truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that KWG has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second - Party Opinion . Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opi nion on the KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the GBP and GLP. Sustainalyti cs highlights the following elements of KWG Group’s Green Bond Framework: • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible categories – Green Buildings, Energy Efficiency, Pollution Prevention and Control, Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management, and Renewable Energy – are aligned with those recognized by the GBP and GLP. Sustainalytics notes the following projects and activities will be financed primarily in China. - Under the Green Buildings category, the Group intends to finance and/or refinance the constructio n or renovation of existing buildings which have obtained or are expected to obtain one of the following minimum green building certification levels: Chinese Green Building Evaluation Label ”2 Star”, LEED “Gold”, BREEAM “Excellent”, BEAM Plus “Gold”, or ot her equivalent international standards. For Sustainalytics’ assessment of these building certification schemes, please refer to Appendix 1. Sustainalytics views these certification schemes as credible, and the associated minimum certification levels as ali gned with market practice. - Within the Energy Efficiency category, KWG may finance smart technologies and/or systems in new and existing buildings that improve energy efficiency, including smart meters, heating ventilation and air conditioning systems, aut o or LED lighting, lift system, and building controls . The Framework also includes financing for the refurbishment of existing buildings which lead to an improvement of at least 15% in energy efficiency . In Sustainalytics ’ opinion a n improvement of at least 20% is required in order to meet market expectations , and Sustainalytics encourages KWG to finance the refurbishment of buildings that achieve a t least this level of minimum energy efficiency improvement . Eligible expenditures with in this category may also include research and development (R&D) of energy efficiency design and technologies for buildings and construction. R&D expenditures will not exceed 20% of issuance. While Sustainalytics recognizes that R&D has the potential to dr ive positive environmental outcomes, it is also acknowledged that it is more challenging to quantify the direct impacts of such investments. As such, Sustainalytics encourages KWG Group to prioritize R&D investments that have reasonable assurance of implem entation, as well as achievement of measurable impact in the near - term. - Regarding Pollution Prevention and Control, KWG may finance and or refinance expenditures and investments in waste management that aim to prevent, minimize and/or recycle waste.,Second - Party Opinion KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework 4 Sustainalytics supports efforts to prevent and reduce waste generation and the promotion of recycling . - In the Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management category, the Framework defines the eligibility for the following investments: construction, developme nt, installation, operation and maintenance of infrastructure or equipment for sewage treatment , wastewater treatment, recycling of wastewater, installation of rainwater collection systems, installation of water - saving devices such as sensor faucets in wat er facilities. Sustainalytics views these activities as contributing to reducing stress and pollution of water systems . - With respect to Renewable Energy, KWG may finance or refinance the installation of renewable solar technology including photovoltaic energy systems, solar powered water systems and solar powered water - heating systems. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - KWG’s internal process in evaluating and selecting projects is managed by the Green Finance Working Group (GFWG), which is comprised by senior representatives from f inance and t reasury, i nvestor r elations, r isk c ontrol, and a udit departments, and other relevant business units . KWG ’s o peration department shortlists eligible projects and nominates them to the GFWG to review and approve the final selection of projects according to the criteria defined in this Framework. Based on these elements, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - KWG’ s process for management of proceeds is overseen by the finance and treasury department. Proceeds will be allocated on a portfolio approach and KWG will set up a Green Finance Register to earmark and track the allocation of proceeds. Should any proceeds remain unallocated KWG will ma nage them in line with the Group’s liquidity management policy. Temporary investment of unallocated proceeds will exclude high pollution activities or projects that are in conflict with the eligibility criteria under this Framework . If an asset ceases to m eet eligibility it will be removed from the portfolio of eligible projects and KWG will strive to replace it as soon as possible. Additionally, if an eligible project is involved in material and critical controversies, KWG commits to substitute that projec t with an alternative eligible project. KWG commits to fully allocate the net proceeds of each GFT within 24 months of each GFT’s issuance. Based on these elements, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Reporting: - KWG intends to report annually on the allocation of proceeds on its annual reports or green finance reports , until full allocation . The allocation reporting will include details such as information, a ggregate amount of proceeds allocated to Eligible Projects , and b alance of unallocated proceeds from of each outstanding GFT, and p roject examples, subject to confidentiality . In addition, KWG is committed to reporting on the environmental and social impact of the eligible projects, subject to the nature of Eligib le Projects and availability of information. R elevant impact indicators includ e annual GHG emissions reduced/avoided (tCO 2 eq), annual energy savings (MWh), and cubic meters of rainwater collected and re - used. For a full list of impact indicators please re fer to Appendix 2: Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Based on these elements, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice . Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 and Green Loan Principles 202 1 Sustainalytics has determined that the KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP and GLP . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 2 : Green Bond/Green Bond Prog ramme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of KWG Contribution of framework to KWG ’s sustainability s trategy 6 KWG strives to promote green building projects but lacks an official sustainability strategy and sustainability goals . As a property developer, KWG recognizes its role in minimizing its impacts on environment from its operations . KWG demonstrates a commitment to developing green buildings with conside ration to the following pillars (i) e nvironm ental performance , (ii) c onstruction materials, (iii) e nergy - saving design, and (iv) community care. 6 KWG, “Annual Report 2019”, (2020), at: https://www.kwggroupholdings.com/upload/file/2 020 - 04 - 23/60cf93fd - e25f - 486f - bd8d - 3f7bf5064090.pdf,Second - Party Opinion KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework 5 KWG actively manages the environmental performance of its developments , including office s and hotels , considering the impacts of climate change. For instance, in its “ W ” hotel in Guan g zhou , KWG replaced more than 90% of the traditional lights with LED energy efficient lights , engaged approved recycling company for waste separation and recycling and stoppe d providing disposable goods without request. Additionally, for its “Apex Jiangmen” project , KWG has substituted wood mo l ds with aluminum alloy molds which are reusable , reducing the waste generated at the construction site . These are just a few examples of the different practices applied by KWG to reduce its environmental footprint, preserve resources, and prevent waste. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework is aligned w ith the C ompany’s overall sustainability initiatives and will further the Company’s action on its key environmental priorities. However, Sustainalytics notes the overall absence of a clear sustainability strategy with associated targets and, as such, encou rages KWG to develop an official sustainability strategy and establish time - bounded quantitative environmental targets for its sustainability goals. Well - positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the net proceeds from the bonds issued under the Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are recognized by the GBP 2018 and GLP 202 1 to have positive environmental impact, Sustainalytics is aware that such eligible projects could also lead to negative environmental and social outcomes . Some key environmental and social risks associated with the eligible projects, could include occupational health and safety, community relations, land use and biodiversit y issues associated with large - scale infrastructure development, emissions, effluents, and waste generated in construction . Sustainalytics is of the opinion that KWG is able to manage and mitigate potential risks by abiding by applicable laws, and through implementation of the following regulations and measures : 6 • KWG complies with national laws and regulation including : o Construction Law of the People’s Republic of China : 7 KWG is obliged to take protective and safety measures in case the construction site is expected to harm surrounding buildings, structures, and special working environments in the neighborhood. Furthermore, according to the law , KWG should control and dispose of the dust, waste gas, wastewater and solid waste, and noise and vibration emitted from the construction site to protect environment. o Regulation on the Administration of Construction Project Environmental Protection and Environmental Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China, 8 , 9 which require s Environmental Impact Assessment s (EIA) for the development of large - scale infrastructure projects, such as building development . As part of EIA requirements , construction p rojects having substantial impacts on the environment are obliged to prepare an environmental impact statement including environmental risk assessment and environmental protection measures . After the initial examination by authorities in charge of the cons truction project, t he competent administrative department of environmental protection of the State Council will approve the construction project based on the environmental impact statement. • In regard to waste generated in construction, KWG commits to improving the following four areas to minimize waste generation: (i) formulate material supply plan, (ii) promote new construction technology, (iii) make a greater effort in the planning and mana gement of construction work, and (iv) recycle waste materials. • In regard to occupational health and safety at construction sites , KWG has established the Quality and Safety Administrative Measures . According to the Measures, safety officers of regional branch companies are assigned to oversee regular quality and safety trainin g aimed at advancing safety awareness of construction workers . Furthermore, KWG conducts regular site inspections for safety and protection, safe use of electricity, machinery and equipment, on - site fire prevention, and material stacking and storage. • KWG conducts assessment s on its suppliers ’ qualification against the Company’s standards by examining certificates, applicable information on sustainable dev elopment (e.g. sustainable raw materials, strict management of waste, etc). After an initial assessment, KWG conducts an on - site inspection o f suppliers’ plants and their materials to ensure that they comply with the relevant environmental and social requi rements of KWG’s supplier code of conduct. 7 ILO, “Construction Law of the People’s Republic of China”, at: https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/76995/108052/F - 1117495410/CHN76995%20Eng.pdf 8 ILO, “Environmental Protection Law of the People’s Repu blic of China”, at: https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/92655/108043/F315004188/CHN92655%20Eng.pdf 9 Government of China, “Regulation on the Administration of Construction Project Environmental Protection”, at: http://en.moj.gov.cn/pdf/RegulationsonEnvironmentalProtectionManagementforConstructionProjects.pdf,Second - Party Opinion KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework 6 Based on these laws , regulations, and measures , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that KWG has implemented adequate measures and is well - positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible categories. Sustainalytics encourages the Company to further integrate community consultation processes in the design and construction phase of all large infrastructure projects. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds Al l five use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP and GLP . Sustainalytics has focused on two where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context. The impact of financing green buildings and energy efficiency projects in China China has been challenged with its energy sector owing to the growing demand for energy, inefficient use of energy, 10 and rapid urbanization. 11 Give n the expected urban population to reach one billio n people by 2030 in China, 12 the urban real estate sector will continue to grow. T he China Construction Energy Saving Committee states that energy consumption from the building sector accounted for 21% of China’s aggregate energy use, with around 19.5% of energy‐related CO 2 emissions in 2017. 11 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) notes that the building sector has the largest cost - effective GHG mitigation potential, delivering savings and economic gains through the i mplementation of existing technologies, building design, and sound policy development. 13 In 2017, t he Ministry of Housing and Urban - Rural Development of China issued the 13th Five Y ear P lan for Building Energy Efficiency and Green Building Development (2015 - 2020) where a 20% growth target in energy efficiency was set for newly constructed buildings compared to the 2015 level . 14 Additionally, t he plan aims to increase the share of certified green buildings to 50% in China among all newly constructed buildings in urban areas within the same timeframe. 15 At the end of 2020, t he Government of China has established it s climate target of carbon neutr ality by 2060 . 16 Following th e 2060 target, detailed climate and energy targets in different sectors will be determined by 2021 in the 14 th Five Year Plan (2021 - 2025) . Sustainalytics recognizes the importance of green building development in China and its impacts on reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in the country. Sustainalytics expects that KWG’s financing for green buildings and energy efficiency projec ts may contribute to reducing GHG emissions from the built environment in China, thereby facilitating the transit to a decarbonized economy . Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form a n agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. This green bond advances the following SDGs and targets: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Green Buildings 11.

Sustainalytics expects that the project s funded by the green bond proceeds will provide positive environmental impact . The KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Fra mework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use of proceed s categor ies will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goa ls 6, 7, 11, and 12. Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that KWG has adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that KWG is well - positioned to issue green bonds and that th e KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018 and Green Loan Principles 2021 .,Second - Party Opinion KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework 8 Appendi ces Appendix 1: Green Building Certification Schemes 17 Hing Kong, Building Environmental Assessment Method, at: https://www.hkgb c.org.hk/eng/beam - plus/beam - plus - new - buildings/ LEED Chinese Green Building Evaluation Label (China 3 - Star) BREEAM HK BEAM Plus 17 Background Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a US Certification System for residential and commercial buildings used worldwide. LEED was developed by the non - profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and covers the design, construction, maintenance and operation of buildings. The Chinese 3 - Star Green Building Standard is a Certi fication System used in China for residential and public buildings (including commercial, hotel and government - owned) that was introduced in 2006 by MOHURD (Ministry of Housing and Urban - Rural Development). BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environme ntal Assessment Method) was first published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in 1990. Based in the UK. Used for new, refurbished and extension of existing buildings. BEAM Society Limited (BSL), owner of the Building Environmental Assessment Me thod (BEAM), is a public body established in 2010. It owns BEAM Plus - a green building assessment tool tailor - made for the high - rise, high density built environment of sub - tropical climate in Hong Kong.

Each rating system is designed to apply to a specific sector (e.g. New Construction, Major Renovation, Core and Shell Development, Schools - /Retail - /Healthcare New Construction and Major Renovations, Existing Buildings: Operation and Maintenance). Prerequisites: The system functions on a checklist basis, with 1 - Star buildings meeting 26 criteria, 2 - Star with an additional 43 items and 3 - Star on a further 14 items. Criteria and weightin g differ for public and residential buildings, more weight is given to energy and material savings, while the standard for residential buildings places greater importance on urban land saving and outdoor environments. Prerequisites depending on the levels of certification + Credits with associated points This number of points is then weighted by item and gives a BREEAM level of certification, which is based on the overall score obtained (expressed as a percentage). Majority of BREEAM issues are flexible, meaning that the client can choose which to comply with to build their BREEAM performance score. BREAAM has two stages/ audit reports: a ‘BREEAM Design Stage’ and a ‘Post Construction Stage’, with different assessment criteria. Prerequisites for each performance area + Credits with associated points Detailed compliance with legal requirements is a prerequisite for the award of credits. For every performance area BEAM prescribes different prerequisites. Every applicable prerequisite in every BEAM cat egory must be achieved for the project to be assessed. Credits are allocated for each performance area, and every area is weighted as per international consensus. The Overall Assessment Grade is determined by the percentage (%) of the applicable credits gained under each performance category and its weighting factor.

Second - Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second - Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second - Party Opinion. It normally entails an as sessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification ma y focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestatio n regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can hav e its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredi ted third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified thir d parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion KWG Group Holdings Limited Green Finance Framework 15 Disclaimer Copyright ©202 1 Sustainalytics.
