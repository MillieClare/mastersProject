The Guidelines communicate what an issuer is expected to do to issue a credible green bond. Sustainalytics assessed the alignment between the Framework and the ‘should’ items outlined in the Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 20 20 .,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 2 Introduction Founded in 19 25 and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank , Limited (“SuMi TRUST” or “the Bank”) is a Japanese trust bank that provides a broad range of financial services including asset management, real estate management, financial services, and co nsulting service. The Bank forms the core of Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group and has offices domestically as well as overseas , including North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. SuMi TRUST has developed the Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Framework under which it intends to issu e multiple green bonds and use the proceeds to finance and/or refinance projects that generate environmental benefits. T he F ramework defines eligibility criteria in the following a reas: 1. R en ewable E nergy 2. E nergy E fficiency 3. C lean T ransportation 4. P ollution P revention and C ontrol 5. G reen Buildings SuMi TRUST engaged Sustainalytics to review the Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond F ramework , dated February 2021, 1 and provide a S econd - P arty O pinion on Framework’s environmental credentials and its alignment with GBP 2 and Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2020. 3 A summary overview of the Framework has been provided in Appendix 1 . Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent 4 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the exte nt t o which the eligible categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • T he Framework’s alignment with the GBP and Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2020; • The credibility and anticipated positive im pacts of the use of proceeds ; • The alignment of the issuer ’ s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, v ersion 1. 7 . 1 , which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of SuMi TRUST ’s Corporate Planning Department t o understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. SuMi TRUST representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of SuMi TR UST to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalyt ics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. 1 SuMi TRUST had engaged with Sustainalytics in August 2018 to provide a second party opinion (SPO) on its Framework and has re engaged to revise a previous SPO (dated August 2018) in February 2021. This SPO h as been updated to incorporate new information provided by the Bank on the four core components including eligibility criteria. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the changes do not have a material effect on the impact of the intended use of bond procee ds or the Framework’s alignment with the GBP. 2 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - soci al - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ . 3 Ministry of the Environment, Japan, “Green Bond Guidelines, 2020”, at: http://www.env.go.jp/policy/guidelines_set_version_with%20cover.pdf 4 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustainalytics and ensuring analyst independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust con flict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consistency of process, structural separation of commercial and res earch (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparency.,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 3 Any update of the present Second - Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and SuMi TRUST . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment wit h future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the intended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or argument either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that SuMi TRUST has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this SPO. Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the GBP 201 8 . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of the F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible categories for the use of proceeds — R enewable E nergy, E nergy E fficiency, C lean T ransportation, P ollution P revention and C ontrol, and G reen B uildings — are recognized by the GBP as project categories with clear environmental impact. Please see Section 3 for Sustainalytics ’ assessment on impact of the use of proceeds. - Within the Renewable Energy category, SuMi TRUST intends to invest in the acquisition, development, construction and operation of infrastructure, facilities, and equipment that generate or transmit solar energy, solar thermal energy, wind energy, geothermal energy , biomass energy and hydropower. Sustainalytics positively notes the following elements of the Framework: ▪ Geothermal energy projects are subject to direct emissions threshold less than 100gCO 2 /kWh. ▪ Hydropower projects are restricted to small run - of - river hydro facilities with less than 25 megawatts or run of river hydropower assets w ithout pondage . ▪ For b iomass energy, biomass sources are limited to sustainable feedstock that do not compete with food production and/or waste materials, while excluding palm oil, wood pulp, waste from peat, non - certified feedstock , peat and unknown sources in non - waste biomas s energy projects . Additionally, all projects are intended to have direct emissions of less than 100gCO 2 /kWh . - Under the Energy Efficiency c ategory, t he proceeds will be allocated towards infrastructure, equipment, technology and processes related to smart grids, energy storage, automation and intelligence in the power transmission network, distribution and related systems that improve energy efficiency. - For the Clean Transportation category, the Bank intends to finance e xpenditure s related to i) the develo pment, manufacturing and acquisition of non - fossil fuel based vehicles including electric and hydrogen vehicles as well as associated infrastructure, and ii) the development, operation and upgrade of rail transport, cycling and other non - motorised transport . Sustainalytics notes that the Framework defines the criteria that excludes fossil fue l - based transportation and,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 4 associated infrastructure , and transportat ion with the main objective of transporting fossil fuel from eligible projects, which is in line with market practice . - In the Pollution Prevention and Control category, SuM i TRUST will finance t he development, construction and operation of pollution preven tion and control facilities such as waste recycling and waste - to - energy power plants . For the feedstock of waste to energy power plants, SuMi TRUST, under the Framework, has committed to i) excluding plastics, rubber, tire - derived fuels (TDF), gas capture from operational landfills, and landfill gas flaring and ii) ensur ing the removal of recyclable materials , which Sustainalytics views positively . - With respect to t he G reen B uilding category, SuMi TRUST’s eligibility criteria are based on international and regional third - party certification standards including LEED “Gold” or above , BREEAM “ Excellent” or abov e , and CASBEE “A Rank” or above , DBJ Green Building Certification “4 Star” or above, and BELS “4 Star” or above. Sustainalytics views that the focus on the top two levels of certifications aligns with market practice considering that they provide a higher level of positive impact and are generally preferred by investors as a benchmark. (Please see Appendix 2 for Sustainalytics assessment s on these certification schemes). Under the same category, SuMi TRUST will invest in buildings that meet the abovementioned criteria and are owned by J - REIT (Japanese Real Estate Investment Trusts) where the allocation amounts to eligible green buildings owned by J - REITs may be calculated based on pro - rata share of eligible green buildings’ acquisition cost. The Bank has confirmed that the net proceeds allocated to J - REITs project will be no greater than the amount lent to J - REITs or investment exposure to eligible projects/assets . - Under the Framework, SuMi TRUST has confirmed that the Bank will not invest in projects associated with defenc e and security, nuclear power generation, coal - fired power generation, mining and tobacco sectors as well as all fossil fuel - based assets. - SuMi TRUST’s look - back period for refinancing activities is 24 months prior to the issuance of the respective bonds . - “ E ligible Green Projects” are defined in the Framework, in which the projects must i) meet the abovementioned criteria, ii) fall under Category B or Category C under the Equator Principles for Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, Clean Transportation or P ollution Prevention and Control , and iii) meet the abovementioned look - back period for refinancing and/or for future investment. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - Several projects teams including Sustainability Management Department, Wholesale Business Planning Department, Structured Finance Department, and Treasury Unit, Global Markets are responsible for establishing the eligible criteria outlined in the Framework. The nominated projects will be evaluated and selected by Wholesale Bu siness Planning Department and Structured Finance Department based on the eligib ility criteria, and further verified by the Sustainability Management Department . The final decision will be made by the Wholesale Business Planning Department . - Based on the c lear process and responsibilities for selecting eligible projects, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - SuMi TRUST ’ process for management of proceeds is overseen by the Wholesale Business Planning Department . I nternal systems ha ve been established by the Bank to track the proceeds at least once a year and ensure that the net proceeds from the green bonds are allocated to Eligible Green Projects. P ending the allocation, the net proc eeds will be invested in overnight or other short - term financial instruments , while t he unallocated proceeds is subject to the exclusion criteria outlined in the Framework. - Based on the use of i nternal system s , as well as the handling of unallocated proceeds, Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Reporting: - SuMi TRUST will provide allocation and impact reporting on its website on an annual basis. - Allocation reporting will be update d at least annually u ntil full allocation and as necessary thereafter in the event of material developments, and will include a brief description of the,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 5 Eligible Green Projects funded and the current funded amounts, loan agreement dates, as well as assertions by management on the proceeds . - I mpact reporting will be conducted until full allocation and will include tonnes of CO 2 emission equivalent avoided, the amount of energy saved (MW) , emissions of CO 2 per passenger kilometer travelled, tonnes of waste reduced/recycled, and the number and certification level of buildings. - SuMi TRUST is committed to receiving issuance reports from an independent provider after the bond issuance s. - Based on SuMi TRUST’s allocation and impact reporting commitments along with post issuance reports , Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics has determined that the Framework aligns to the four core component s o f the GBP . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 4 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form . Alignment with Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 20 20 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Framework is in line with Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2020 developed by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan . The Guidelines communicate what an issuer is expected to do to issue a credible gr een bond. Sustainalytics assessed the alignment between the Framework and the ‘should’ items outlined in the Japan ’s Green Bond Guidelines 2020 . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 3 : Alignment with Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2020. Sectio n 2: Sus tainability Performance of the SuMi TRUST Contribution of framework to SuMi TRUST ’s sustainability strategy and targets In line with SuMi TRUST Group’s Management Princi ples, the Bank de monstrates a strong commitment to contributing to solve environmental and social issues through its core busines s by setting out a Sustainability Policy 5 . Through the policy, t he Bank commit s to in corporating sustainability considerations into its business , and focus es on five key themes 6 : (i) climate change, (ii) natural capital (biodiversity), (iii) environmentally friendly property, (iv) sustainable (ESG) investment, and (v) issues in a super - aged society . Sustainalytics highlights the following policies, targets, and initiatives for being particularly relevant to the Framework:  SuMi TRUST Group sets out a sustainable financing long - term goal 7 to allocate 5 trillion JPY towards sustainable finance from FY2021 to FY2030 , including 3 trillion JPY environmental finance such as renewable energy and green buildings. 8  SuMi TRUST Group , through its action guidelines for climate change, i s committed to the development and provision of products and services that contribute to mitigate climate change. 9 T he B ank take s several initiatives in promot ing climate change mitigation , providing finance to renewable energy projects through project finance and fund management , and financial products such as loans in acc ordance with the Principles for P ositive Impact F inance, which aims to d eliver positive impact and mitigate adverse impact on the environment, society, and economy . 10  SuMi TRUST Group is a signatory to several initiatives that foster sustainability in the financial sector, such as the UN Global Compact, Principles for Financial Action towards a Sustainable Society, 11 Principles for Responsible Investment , Principles for Responsible Banking , and UNEP FI . 12 Moreover, 5 Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, “Basic Policy on the Social Responsibility of Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group (Sustainability Policy)”, at: https://www.smth.jp/en/csr/philosophy/csr_policy/index.html 6 Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, “Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings ESG Report 2019/2020 ”, at: https://www.smth.jp/en/csr/report/2019/E - all.pdf 7 Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, “ Investor Meeting on Financial Results for 1HFY2020 ”, at: https://www.smth.jp/en/ir/presentation/E201118 - 1.pdf 8 Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, “Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Sustainability Report 2020/2021(Japanese only) ”, at: https://www.smth.jp/csr/report/2020/full/all.pdf 9 Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, “Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings ESG Report 2019/2020”, at: https://www.smth.jp/en/csr/report/2019/E - all.pdf 10 Su mitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, “Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings ESG Report 2019/2020 ”, at: https://www.smth.jp/en/ csr/report/2019/E - all.pdf 11 The Principles for Financial Action towards a Sustainable Society is a set of voluntary guidelines established by Japan's major f inancial institutions 12 Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, “Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings ESG Report 2019/2020 ”, at: https://www.smth.jp/en/csr/report/2019/E - all.pdf,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 6 SuMi TRUST Group is a member of the Climate Action 100+ initiative 13 and has integrated the Equator Principles, further highlighting the importance of sustainability within the B ank . Given SuMi TRUST Group’s policy, targets, and initiatives for sustainability , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the SuMi TRUST is well positione d to issue green bonds and that the issuance of green bonds will help the B ank to advance its sustainability strategy. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the net proceeds from the green bonds issued under the Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are recognized by the GBP to have positive environmental impact, it is acknowledged that such eligible projects could also lead to negative environmental and social outcomes, which may damage SuMi TRUST’s reputation as a lender to projects. Some key environmental and social risks associated with the eligible projects could include large energy, transportation and real estate infrastru cture projects, as well as occupational health and safety for construction work. Sustainalytics considers SuMi TRUST to be well prepared to manage related social and environmental risks based on the following: ▪ SuMi TRUST appli es the Equator Principles fo r project finance and project - related corporate loans . 14 SuMi TRUST excludes projects from being financed from the green bond proceeds that have been classified as having potential significant adverse environmental and social risks and/or impacts that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented according to the Equator Principles. Project evaluation takes into consideration environmental and social impact assessments. ▪ Under the Framework, SuMi TRUST limits financing from its green bond s to hydro power plants with a capacity below 25 MW , excluding large hydro power plants that often have a high environmental and social impact. In addition, SuMi TRUST excludes the following sectors: defense and security, palm oil, wood pulp, waste from pea t, non - certified feedstock in non - waste biomass energy projects, nuclear power generation, coal - fired power generation, mining and tobacco sectors as well as all fossil fuel based assets, fossil fuel based transportation / infrastructure and transportation with the main objective of transporting fossil fuel. ▪ SuMi TR U ST is a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) and United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). 15 As a signatory of PRB, the Bank is committed to (i) r educing the negative impact and managing risks from its activities, products and services in order to increase its positive impact , (ii) setting at least two targets addressing the most material impacts aligned with the SDGs and Paris Climate Agreement, a nd (iii) publicly report ing on its progress. 16 Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All five use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP and Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2020. Sustainalytics explains why those project categories produces positive environmental impacts in Japan as follows: Importance of renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings and low carbon transportation for achieving Japan’s climate goal Japan heavily relies on thermal power generations from oil, coal and natural gas, to make up for the loss of nuclear power plants that were shut down following the Fukushima - Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, which accounted for almost 30% of Japan’s total electricity production before the disaster. 17 In 2 018, thermal power accounted for 77% of total power generation , with nuclear energy accounting for 6% and renewable sources 13 Climate Action 100+ is an initiative led by investors to engage systemically important greenhouse gas emitters and other comp anies across the global economy that have significan t opportunities to drive the clean energy transition and help achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. https://climateaction100.wordpress.com/ 14 Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc, “The Equator Principles and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank”, at : https://www .smth.jp/en/csr/management/equator_principles/index.html 15 Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc, “ESG/CSR Report 2019/2020”: https://www.smth.jp/en/csr/report/2019/E - all.pdf 16 United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, “Principles for Responsi ble Banking”, https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/ 17 Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, “FY2018 Energy Supply and Demand Report (Final Figures) (Japanese only)”, at: https://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/statistics/total_energy/pdf/stte_029.pdf,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 7 (wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and hydro) accounting for 1 7 %. 18 As Japan committed to a 26% GHG emissions reduction in FY2030 com pared to FY2013 levels, the government aims to increas e the share of renewable energy supply to 22 - 24% , and achiev e 35% increase in energy efficiency, by FY2030, to meet its GHG reduction target. 19 20 Furthermore, following Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga ’s pledge to reduc e GHG emissions to net zero by 2050 on October 2020, Japan commits to maximizing renewable energy use by 2050 with the reference goal of renewable energy sources accounting for 50 - 60% of the country’s electricity production , as well as promo ting energy conservation . 21 22 The f inal energy consumption in the commercial and other , and residential sectors related to buildings increased by approx imately 20% compared to 1990 , 23 and building s accounts for approximately 30% of Japan ’s total CO 2 emissions , 24 indicating the importance of measures to increase energy efficient buildings, as manifested in the Building Energy Efficiency Act in 8 July 2015. 25 Moreover, the transport sector accounts for about 20% of Japan’s CO 2 emissions. 26 While the c ountry reduced its CO 2 emissions from the sector by 6.2 % between FY 201 8 and FY 2013, 27 further investments in clean transportation projects are needed to support Japan’s transition towards a decarboni z ed economy and achieve its GHG reduction targets. Given the importance of renewable energy, building energy efficiency and the transport sec tor, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that SuMi TR U ST ’s use of proceeds in these categories is impactful and expected to contribute to meeting Japan’s GHG emission targets. Importance of Pollution Prevention and Control Japan’s recycling rate for municipal waste hovers around 20% , which is below the OECD average of 34% and one of the lowest among the 34 member countries. 28 29 A s a country with high population density and limited land resources, Japan faces a shortage of landfill sites with the remaining capacity estimated at 21.6 years , 30 and relies on incineration as the main method for waste treatment. 31 Giv en this situation, the Japanese government sets out national target s for FY2025 to promote resource ci rculation and reduce waste generation , which includ es doubl ing the market size of business related to material - cycle compared to FY2000, achiev ing 18 Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, “FY2018 Energy Supply and Demand Report (Final Figures) (Japanese only)”, at: https://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/statistics/total_ene rgy/pdf/stte_029.pdf 19 “Submission of Japan’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC ) ”, at: https://www.env.go.jp/en/headline/2442.html 20 Ministry of the Environment, “Reference Material (3) Japan's INDC (Japanese only)”, at: https://www.env.go.jp/policy/kikouhendou/kondankai01/02 - 3_siryou1 - 1.pdf 21 Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet, “Policy Speech by the Prime Minister to the 203rd Session of the Diet”, at: http s://japan.kantei.go.jp/99_suga/statement/202010/_00006.html 22 Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, “Green growth strategies associated with carbon neutrality in 2050 (Japanese only) ”, at: https://www.meti.go.jp/press/2020/12/20201225012/20201225012 - 2. pdf 23 Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, “FY2018 Energy Supply and Demand Report (Final Figures) (Japanese only)”, at: https://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/statistics/total_energy/pdf/stte_029.pdf 24 Ministry of the Environment, “Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Fiscal Year 2018 (Final Figures) (Japanese only)”, at: https://www.env.go.jp/press/files/jp/113761.pdf 25 The act provides re gulatory measures to ensure compliance with energy efficiency standards for large - scale non - residential buildings, and encourages the use of green building certification systems, such as CASBEE.

Sustainalytics considers that the projects funded by the green bond proceeds are expected to provide positive environmental impact while further contribut ing to the achievement of SuMi TRUST Group ’s Sustainability Polic y and SuMi TRUST ’s s ustainable financ ing long - term goal as well as promotion of measures against climate change pursued by the Japanese government and SDGs 7 , 11 and 12 . The Framework defines eligible green project s , setting out specific thresholds and exclusionary criteria . Additionally, Su Mi TRUST w ill conduct i) its selection process based on the Equator Principles, ensuring that projects funded through the bond proceeds have minimal or limited negative environmental or social impacts , ii) its management of proceeds using internal system s , overseen by the Wholesale Business Planning Department and iii) its allocation and impact reporting commitments along with post issuance reports to be provided by an independent provider . 32 Calculated by dividing the a mount of cyclical use by the amount of w aste 33 Ministry of the Environment, “the 4th Fundamental Plan for Establishing a Sound Material - Cycle Society”, at: https://www.env.go.jp/recycle/recycle/circul/keikaku/pam4_E.pdf,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 9 Based on the above points, Sustainalytics is confident th at SuMi TRUST’s G reen B ond Framework is robust, credible and transparent and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018 and Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2020 .,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 10 Appendices Appendix 1: Framework Overview For the purpose of issuing green bonds, SuMi TRUST has developed the following Framework which addresses the four key core components of the GBP: use of proceeds, project evaluation and selection process, management of proceeds, and reporting, in February 202 1 . The Framework belongs to SuMi TRUST . 1. Use o f proceeds The proceeds of the green bond will be allocated towards financing/refinancing projects that meet the following eligibility criteria. 1.1 Eligibility Criteria SuMi TRUST shall apply the use of proceeds to finance and/or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and future qualifying environmental projects (“Eligible Green Projects”) as defined by its internal investment criteria as specified below. Eligible Project Categories “Eligible Green Projects” means projects meet all of the thr ee conditions i), ii) and iii) below. i) A project falls in one or more of the p roject c ategories (a) to (e) below (a) Renewable Energy The acquisition, development, construction and operation of infrastructure, facilities, and equipment that generate or transmit renewable energy, including: solar energy, solar thermal energy, wind energy, geothermal energy (restricted to the projects with direct emissions of less than 100gCO 2 /kWh), biomass (restricted to sustainable feedstock not competing wit h food production and/or waste materials, and restricted to the projects that have direct emissions of less than 100gCO 2 /kWh ) energy and small run - of - river hydro facilities with generation capacity of 25 megawatts or less or run of river hydropower assets without pondage (b) Energy Efficiency The manufacturing, development and operation of infrastructure, equipment, technology and processes related to smart grids, energy storage, automation and intelligence in the power transmission netwo rk, distribution and related systems to improve energy management (c) Clean Transportation Expenditure for the development, manufacturing and acquisition of clean energy vehicles (non - fossil fuel based vehicles, including electric/hydrogen vehicles) and s upporting infrastructure, and the development, operation and upgrade of low - carbon public transportation facilities (including rail transport, cycling and other non - motorised transport) (d) Pollution Prevention and Control The development, construction an d operation of pollution prevention and control facilities, such as waste recycling and waste - to - energy power plants. The waste - to - energy feedstock will include household waste, commercial waste, and landfill gas.

Materials recovery and recycling will be done prior to incineration (e) Green Buildings The acquisition, development and construction of n ew, existing or refurbish ed buildings which have received or will receive during the life of the Green Bond at least one of the following green building classifications. • LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design): LEED Platinum or Gold • BREEAM (Building Research Establ ishment Environmental Assessment Methodology): BREEAM Outstanding or Excellent • CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency): CASBEE S Rank or A Rank • DBJ (Development Bank of Japan) Green Building Certification: DBJ Green Buil ding 5 Star or 4 Star,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 11 • BELS (Building - Housing Energy - efficiency Labelling System): BELS 5 Star or 4 Star Eligible green buildings may include those owned by J - REIT (Japanese Real Estate Investment Trusts), and in such case, the allocation amounts to eligibl e green buildings owned by J - REITs may be calculated based on pro - rata share of eligible green buildings’ acquisition cost. The net proceeds allocated to J - REITs project will be no greater than the amount lent to J - REITs or investment exposure to eligible projects/assets ii) For any project categorized as (a) to ( d ) above, the project must be further categorized as Category B or Category C under the Equator Principles as published by the Equator Principles Association 34 iii) Financing disbursed by SuMi TRUST to an existing or new project which has taken place (a) within the 24 months prior to the relevant issue date of a Green Bond or (b) after the issue date of a Green Bond but before the relevant maturity date of such Note. For long - dated green assets that are refinanced by proceeds of multiple Green Bonds, SuMi TRUST will disclose the age and remaining useful life of the assets to an independent party prior to the initial issuance of the Green Bonds from this Green Bond Framework and update the information when such independent party provides an annual review as described below. The information provided will be supported by a review from such independent party to confirm the continuous environmental benefits of the long - dated asset s. 1.2 Exc lusionary Criteria In addition to the identification process described above, SuMi TRUST’s screening criteria is to exclude: - Non - committed transactions; and - Assets pledged to other financing programme For clarification purposes, the following sectors and activity types are excluded from the Green Bond Framework: defence and security, palm oil, wood pulp, waste from peat, non - certified feedstock , peat and unknown sources in non - waste biomass energy projects, nuclear power generation, coal - fired power generation, mining and tobacco sectors as well as all fossil fuel based assets, fossil fuel based transportation or infrastructure and transportation with the main objective of transporting fossil fuel. 2. Process for project evaluation and selection 2.1 Application of Eligibility and Exclusionary Criteria in Project Selection S u M i TRUST’s Sustainability Management Department , Wholesale Business Planning Department, Structured Finance Department and Treasury Un it , Global Markets worked together to establish the criteria for Eligible Green Projects mentioned above. S u M i TRUST’s Wholesale Business Planning Department and Structured Finance Department will select a project pool that meets all the criteria for Eligi ble Green Projects, and, after verification by the Sustainability Management Department , the Wholesale Business Planning Department would make the final decision on which of the nominated eligible projects will be selected. Net proceeds of the G reen B ond are to be allocated to selected eligible projects. In the selection process described above, SuMi TRUST will apply its screening to exclude: non - committed transactions and assets pledged to other financing programmes. 2.2 Environmental Objectives S u M i TRUST, as one of leading financial institutions, is committed to the active role it plays in contributing to building a sustainable society, and recognises the importance of embedding the principles of social responsibility within all Group activities. Th rough its strategic sustainability initiatives and policies based on its mission, vision and values, S u M i TRUST strives to create shared value by proactively helping address societal problems in conjunction with pursuing the Group's own enterprise value. SuMi TRUST’s approach to sustainability includes, 34 According to the Equator Principles, Category A projects are defined as projects with potential significant adverse environme ntal and social risks and/or impacts that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented. Category B projects have potential limited a dverse environmental and social risks and/or impacts that are few in number, generally site – specific, largely reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures. Category C projects have minimal or no adverse environmental and social risks and/or impacts. Net proceeds of green bond can be allocated to existing and new Category B or C projects which will fall into one or more of the categories (a) to (d) above.,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 12 i) Committing to proactive sustainability management SuMi TRUST strives to identify and manage material sustainability issues as top priorities of the Group’s management, since the Group regards ESG (envi ronmental, social and governance) as a critical foundation for management. ii) Integrating sustainability initiatives in to its business By leveraging its function as a financial group specialized in trust banking, SuMi TRUST aims to provide comprehensive E SG solutions to SuMi TRUST clients, help ing to promote the development of a sustainable society. SuMi TRUST utilizes the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to verify the appropriateness and societal value of the products and services provi ded. iii) Providing values to the community SuMi TRUST believes that providing value to society helps maintain a sound business foundation, and that this is a social responsibility required to conduct business. From this point of view, SuMi TRUST provides value to the community in various forms, taking into consideration the United Nation’s SDGs. 2.3 Process to Mitigate Environmental and Social Risks The Financial Products Administration Department (Social & Environmental Risk Assessment Team) carries out envi ronmental and social risk/impact reviews on projects subject to the Equator Principles to confirm whether protections for the environment and communities are adhered to by the borrower. In environmental and social risk/impact reviews based on screening for ms, the relevant project with project categor ies (a) to ( d ) above is categorized into one of three Categories (Categories A, B, and C) reflecting its environmental and social risks and/or impacts. For category (e), a project is certified into certain certification level by LEED, BREEAM, CASBEE, DBJ Green Building Certification, BELS or any other regional, national or internationally recognised standard or certification, based on assessment of environmental performance of a relevant building. For project categor ies (a) to ( d ), the Financial Products Administration Department (Social & Environmental Risk Assessment Team) conducts detailed reviews based on environmental impact assessment reports that take into account the risk/impact category, the status of the country (designated or non - designated country) where the project is located, and industry. The review outcomes are sent to a credit supervision department, where comprehensive risk assessments for credit decisions are conducted based on the review results. 35 As stipulated in the relevant loan agreement on origi nation, projects subject to the Equator Principles are required to submit regular reports stipulating compliance with important items concerning environmental and social laws, regulations and rules as well as approvals and permits. Based on regular reports submitted by the borrower, S u M i TRUST then checks for compliance with rules relating to the environment and communities. 3. Management of Proceeds S u M i TRUST has established and implemented systems designed to monitor and ensure that the net proceeds from its Green Bonds be allocated to Eligible Green Projects as defined above. SuMi TRUST’s Wholesale Business Planning Department will track the net procee ds of its G reen B onds, using internal systems at least once a year, until the maturity of the G reen B onds. Records will show that an amount equal to the net proceeds of the bonds will be allocated to the financing of existing and future Eligible Green Pro jects. S u M i TRUST will monitor and account for an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds to ensure the allocation of such amount to Eligible Green Projects. Pending the allocation of the net proceeds of a G reen B ond to finance Eligible Green Projects, the net proceeds will be invested in overnight or other short - term financial instruments. The unallocated proceeds is subject to the exclusion criteria listed above. The payment of the principal and interest on the bonds will be m ade from the B ank’s general funds and will not be directly linked to the performance of any Eligible Green Projects. S u M i TRUST will review and update the Eligible Green Projects to which the net proceeds of the bond are allocated. Any proceeds allocated t o projects that have been sold, prepaid, amortized or otherwise become ineligible shall be reallocated to other Eligible Green Projects. SuMi TRUST will use best efforts to substitute any redeemed loans or any other form of financing that are no longer fin anced or refinanced by the net 35 The details of project finance’s evaluation and selection process can be found at the website below: https://www.smth.jp/en/csr/management/equator_principles/index.html,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 13 proceeds and/or if any such loans or any other form of financing cease to be an Eligible Asset as soon as practically possible once an appropriate substitution option has been identified. 4. Reporting 4 .1 Allocation reporting During the life of any relevant Green Bond, S u M i TRUST will provide and keep readily available, on a dedicated website, information on the allocation of the net proceeds of the Green Bonds, to be updated at least annually until full allocation and as nece ssary thereafter in the event of material developments. This information shall include: i. allocation of the net proceeds of those bonds to Eligible Green Projects, which include (a) a brief description of the Eligible Green Projects funded and (b) the current funded amounts, and loan agreement dates . ii. assertions by management that the net procee ds of that tranche or series of G reen B onds are invested either in qualifying Eligible Green Projects or if unallocated, invested in overnight or other short - term financial instruments. 4 .2 Impact reporting In addition, S u M i TRUST will publish on a dedicated website information and assessments relating to the environmental impacts of financed Eligible Green Projects, at least annually until full allocation and as necessary thereafter in the event of material development. The expected environmental impacts of the projects will use relevant indicators as suggested by the ICMA Harmonized Framework for Impact Reporting, subject to data availability and confidentiality, which may include the following impact indicators . • Renewable E nergy projects: tonnes of CO 2 emission equivalent avoided • Energy Efficiency: the amount of energy saved (MW) • Clean Transportation: the CO 2 emissions per passenger kilometer travelled • Pollution and Prevention Control: tonnes of waste reduced/recycled • Green Buildings projects: number and certification level of green buildings for Green Buildings projects The environmental impacts of financed Eligible Green Projects, where reported, will be disclosed on a collective basis. 5. Annual Review For Green Bond s issued under the SuMi TRUST’s Green Bond Framework, i t will engage an independent provider to review the post issuance report on annual basis, and evaluate its conformity with its Framework and the Principles and Standards captioned above, Public disclosu re will be made available through SuMi TRUST’s website https://www.smth.jp/en/csr/greenbond/index.html,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 14 Appendix 2 : Overview and Comparison of Green Building Certification Schemes LEED 36 BREEAM 37 CASBEE Certification 38 DBJ Green Building Certification 39 BELS 40 Background Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a US Certification System for residential and commercial buildings used worldwide. LEED was developed by the non - profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and covers the design, construction, maintenance and operation of buildings. BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) was first published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in 1990. Based in the UK. Used for new, refur bished and extension of existing buildings. The Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency ( CASBEE) Certification is a green building certification scheme in Japan, which a third party certifies the environmental performance of buildi ngs. The certification scheme includes, based on types of buildings: CASBEE for Buildings, CASBEE for Real Estate, and CASBEE for Housing. The Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) Green Building Certification Programme was launched by Development Bank of Japan in 2011 and is operated in conjunction with the Japan Real Estate Institute (JREI), a major appraisal firm in Japan. The certification scheme is recognized as one of Japan’s major regional standards. The certification is available for office buildings, log istics, residential, and retail facilities. The Building - Housing Energy - efficiency Labelling System (BELS) is an energy performance label, issued under guidelines established by Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism. The BELS cer tification scheme evaluates primary energy consumption in order to measure performance of energy conservation.

These points are then added together to obtain the LEED level of certification There are several different rating systems within LEED. Each rating system is designed to apply to a specific sector (e.g. New Construction, Major Renovation, Core and Shell D evelopment, Schools - /Retail - /Healthcare New Construction and Major Renovations, Existing Buildings: Operation and Maintenance). Prerequisites depending on the levels of certification + Credits with associated points This number of points is then weighte d by item 41 and gives a BREEAM level of certification, which is based on the overall score obtained (expressed as a percentage). Majority of BREEAM issues are flexible, meaning that the client can choose which to comply with to build their BREEAM performan ce score. BREAAM has two stages/ audit reports: a ‘BREEAM Design Stage’ and a ‘Post Construction Stage’, with different assessment criteria. Score - based performance level . CASBEE uses the BEE (Built Environment Efficiency) as its assessment indicator , which is calculated from Q (Built Environment Quality) as the numerator and L (Built Environment Load) as the denominator. Q and L are obtained through the classification and rearrangement of the four areas of assessment. * CASBEE for Real Estate does n ot use BEE, additional point system. Certification will not be given, if required item are not met. Score - based performance level. The assessment has a full score of 300 points and consists of 85 questions, 73 of which are regular questions and 12 of whi ch are questions on innovative initiatives. JREI will conduct on the ground review of building performance on the indicators above, and a committee set in JREI will decide the result of certification rank. Score - based performance level. The BELS score is based on the Building Energy Index, obtained by comparing the energy consumption of a building to the standard primary energy consumption of the building type in official guidelines. A two - star rating is equivale nt t o meeting existing e nergy conservation standards, with higher star ratings implying greater savings. The score is calculated by an accredited third party.

Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the insti tution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or pr ocesses relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, t ypically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of re porting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines spec ific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond fr amework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environm ental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.,Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Green Bond Framework 23 Disclaimer Copyr ight ©202 1 Sustainalytics.
