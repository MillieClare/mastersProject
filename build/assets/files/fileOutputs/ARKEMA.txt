E L I G I B L E P R O J E C T L E V E L O F E X P E C T E D I M P A C T A N A L Y S I S Biosourced monomer and polymer production ROBUST Due to the nature of their activities and products, chemicals companies have a high potential impact on the environment including through preventing accidental pollution and reducing atmospheric emissions . According to the In ternational Energy Agency, the direct CO 2 emissions from the chemical production sector reaches around 8 80 MtCO 2 in 2018 3 , while the IPCC estimates Global total emissions (GtCO 2 eq) for chemicals production processes to reach 2,4 GtCO 2 in 2010 . 4 The intende d project aims at c ontributing to the GHG emissions reduction of the company’s activity by producing plastics from renewable feedstock intrinsically less emitting than petro - based chemicals process es (around 40% less emitting with an additional 20% if polymer is sourced with 3 0% recycled content ) and can be recycled several times . The renewable feedstock – castor beans – is a non - edible crop , and the land has not been subject to land conversion in the past 30 years and does not compete with food production , as required by the T EG report 5 . The Issuer has committed that the land has not been subject to land use change from forest in the past 30 years.

A Group Safety and Environment department is responsible for the company’s Health, Safety, Environment and Quality Policy w hich is managed by the operating teams in each region where Arkema is present . In 2018, 54% of the company’s site were manage d under an ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System – or Responsible Care® Management System (RCMS) in the United States . In line with this, Arkema has committed that, once completed, the Singapore p lant will be managed under an ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System. Environmental Impact Assessment and Eco - design Arkema has set up a corporate project manageme nt process that includes an evaluation of the environmental and safety impact o f the plant, to lead if necessary, to a modification of the plant’s design. Several assessments have been conducted, namely: an Environmental Impact Assessment and a Quantitativ e Risk Assessment to map the industrial risks facing the construction, an Energ y Efficiency Opportunity Assessment (EEOA) to quanti f y the energy consumption of the new plant benchmarked against other available technologies and a Pollution Control Study to meet the local environmental requirements and to minimise the residual impacts of the plant (including quantified air emissions, water effluents, noise emissions, and waste generation). In addition, an internal annual environmental assessment will be condu cted. T he Group applies the HAZard IDentification (HAZID) method to take accoun t of the impact of external events, like natural disasters and climate change (includ ing sea level rise) , on the mechanical strength of the construction. Concerning the plants’ outputs, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been conducted for Rilsan ® Polyamide 11 (PA11 ) , attesting to a 40% carbon footprint improvement compared with a competitors’ panel of petro - based polymers that it aims at replacing in targeted applications , the LCA will be validated by a third party . A recycling programme, called Virtucycle™, has been created by Arkema to match ‘source suppliers’ who want their final product and/or recovered material to be recycled with ‘target consumers’ who have a desire to use recycled materials. Virtucycle™ is at its pilot pha se and is expected to be available world wide in the coming years. The Issuer has estimated the water footprint of its products. According to Arkema, due to lack of sufficient data, the comparison with the panel of petro - based polymers could not be conducte d. An area for improvement consists in p roviding the same calculations (conducted for the energy consumption comparison) for the water footprint. Biodiversity As the site will be developed on already urbanized land, there is no competition with potential a rable land and potential endangered species. Concerning the feedstock use, the Issuer has stated that – based on official statistics o n India and Gujara t – the land used has not been subject of land use change fro m forest, food, p asture or protected areas since at least 1990 . A screening has been conducted by Arkema and no protected areas appear to be affected by the selected farms . A part of the selected farms ha s been awarded a Sustainable Castor Caring for Environmental & Social Standards Success code compliance certificate by the Sustainable Castor Association and related auditors (Indocert, SGS and Control Union) ensuring a sustainable production of castor beans covering soil , pesticides use and water management practic es . The Company intend to reach many more farms for training and certification . Areas for improvement consist in formally excluding protected areas (high conservation value land, or high carbon stock land, and that burning is not used for preparing land) and mandating a third party to assess the respect of these criteria for past and future land selection. Environmental/Industrial accident and pollution An Environmental Basel ine Study of the plant has been conducted to determine the impact of the project on the soil and allowing the decommissioning and rehabilitation of the land at the end - of - life of the project. The Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCm) has established a management procedure to identify the risks conce rning soil, water, air pollutants and waste control and related mitigation measures. Arkema’s management system is OHSAS 18001 certified and the plant will be included within its scope of ap plication. Concerning accidental pollution, Arkema has confirmed t hat an Emergency Response plan is being designed and should be available in Q4 2021 before the plant’s start - up.,1 0 / 2 0 2 0 14 SOCIAL RISKS The Issuer has set up a whistleblowing system available to all Arkema employees, business partners and third parties to report any malfunctions in connection with the Arkema group. A Whistleblowing Committee is in charge of processing the concerns raised via the whistleblowing mechanism and may be supported by third parties when necessary. Respect of Fundamental Human and L abour Rights The Issuer has set up an internal system to ensure the respect and promotion of human and labour rights. The topics covered are detailed in the Code of Conduct for Arkema suppliers, whi ch applies to subcontractors and suppliers and covers comp liance with laws and regulations matters on topics including collective bargaining, child labour and forced labour, non - discrimination, health and safety etc. Arkema reserves the right to audit its Suppliers and apply corrective measures in case of non - con formity with the Code of Conduct. Health and Safety For the construction phase, the Issuer has established an integrated Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE ) plan jointly with its EPCm (E ngineering, Procurement and Construction Management) contractor. The HSSE plan covers risk management, safety training, incident investigation, safety rules, safety promotion, selection of contractors, audits and inspections, emergency procedures, and h eal th protection. The EPCm is responsible for the legal safety responsibility record (in accordance with Singapore laws). In addition to EPCm company, Arkema has also deployed its own dedicated safety field supervision team and has incentivised the EPCm co mpa ny on the safety results. All incidents and accidents will be recorded, and a safety monthly review is held between Arkema and the EPCm company. For the operation phase, the Issuer reports to have an integrated systemic approach on Safety, Environment, Hea lth and Quality, consistent with the requirements of Singapore. This includes OHSAS 18001 for occupational health and safety management, and a behaviour - based safety programme. A systematic occupational workplace Health and Safety risk assessment is per for med prior to start - up with an annual update. Integration of social and environmental factors in the procurement In 2014, Arkema has joined Together for Sustainability (TfS), an initiative for a responsible supply chain. The goal of TfS is to develop and im plement a global assessment and audit programme to evaluate and improve sustainability practices in chemical industry supply chain verified by Ecovadis. The Ecovadis assessment results determine the course of action for companies which may include an ex clu sion from Arkema’s supplier panel or improvement plans. In addition, Arkema’s suppliers and subcontractors are required to follow the Issuer’s procedures (for instance regarding safety, waste and foreign workers). In case of breach of these procedures, an action plan has to be put in place and in case of persistent breaches, sanctions would be applied, including through the replacement of the supplier. Community Involvement The Issuer reports that due to the location of the plant (on an island dedicated to industrial activities), the risks on the local communities are low, as the potentially impacted populations are on the mainland at 4.3km distance from the plant. However, the Project is expected to have a positive impact on the local economy through th e i ncreased opportunities on the local job market. This will range from both construction job opportunities and plant operations job opportunities. Business Ethics Arkema discloses several documents on its website to ensure the existence of good business e thi cs and integrity: a Code of Conduct for Arkema suppliers, the Arkema Group Business Conduct & Ethics Code and the Arkema Group Anti - Corruption Policy. These documents cover issues including corruption, bribery, influence peddling, conflicts of interest, ex port and import regulations. Arkema has established a map of corruption - related risks, as part of the general risk map exercise performed by the Group and has implemented a business compliance and ethics programme. Several measures have been put in plac e t o prevent non - compliance with applicable laws and regulations linked to business ethics: guides, regular e - learning and training for Arkema’s employees and a compliance statement signed by all employees potentially exposed to these risks, verification o f b usiness intermediaries prior to their appointment, and systematic approval required prior to any export to countries subject to commercial or financial restrictions.,1 0 / 2 0 2 0 15 PART 2: ISSUER Arkema S.A. manufactures and sells specialty chemicals and advanced mate rials worldwide.

The Company manufactures specialty chemicals for paints, coatings, adhesives, animal feeds, agrochemicals and the oil and gas industry. The Company manufactures cosmetic intermediates such as Orgasol fine powders used in colour cos metics and ingre dients used in shampoo, conditioner and face wash. Arkema has issued an animal testing statement and states in its Universal Registration Document 2019: "Arkema neither conducts triage trials on substances derived from its research nor part icipates in toxi cology research projects that could involve the use of laboratory animals.[...] The Group does not conduct toxicology studies on vertebrate animals other than those required by the authorities and only after an in - depth analysis and applica tion of up - to - da te existing public information on the substances in question. The necessary studies are contracted to outside laboratories which are subject to oversight by the relevant ethics committees." Major involvement in Chemicals of concern : Arkema produces or supp lies restricted chemicals (OSPAR Priority list) and pesticides. Arkema has an estimated turnover from these products which is below 10%. - Production of restricted chemicals: It includes nonylphenol ethoxylates, Surfaline products line, produce d by CECA group company. - Production of pesticides: Arkema supplies Paladin® and Accolade® used to protect vegetable and fruit crops. Additionally, the Company's Triazole products are mainly used as intermediates for the synthesis of active ingredients in a grochemicals (fungicides, herbicides). Minor involvement in Nuclear Power : Arkema has an estimated turnover from involvement in nuclear power which is below 5% of total turnover. This turnover is derived from minor nuclear parts and services such as: - S uppl y of Kynar resin that can be used in a variety of industries and applications, including nuclear waste processing ; - S upply of hydrazine hydrate, which provides anti - corrosion protection for steam generators etc. in nuclear power plants. The Issuer appears t o be not involved in any of the other 14 controversial activities screened under our methodology, namely: Alcohol, Cannabis, Civilian firearms, Coal, Fossil Fuels industry, Unconventional oil and gas, Gambling, Genetic engineering, Human embryonic stem cel ls, High interest rate lending, Military, Pornography, Reproductive Medicine and Tobacco. The controversial activities research provides screeni ng of companies to identify involvement in business activities that are subject to philosophical or moral belief s. The information does not suggest any approval or disapproval on their content from Vigeo Eiris .,1 0 / 2 0 2 0 17 PART 3: CO HERENCE We are of the opinion that the contemplated Bond is co herent with Arkema’s strategic sustainability priorities and sector issues and c ontribute s to achieving the Issuer’s sustainability commitments. Due to the nature of their activities and products, chemicals companies have a high potential impact on the environment. Some material environmental challenges in this sector notably relate to environmental impacts from energy use and atmospheric emissions , accidental pollution and the d evelopment of green products and services . E nergy costs can represent up to 60% of production costs . T herefore , improv ing energy efficiency and reduc ing CO2 e missions is of key interest for companies in th e sector. We are of the opinion that the Green Bond Framework is coherent with Arkema’s main sector sustainability issues, with its publicly disclosed strategic sustainable development priorities, and that it contributes to achieve its sustainable development commit ments and targets. Arkema reports to be working to reduce the consumption of resources such as energy and water, to decrease the emissions stemming from its activity, to develop the use of renewab le resources, and to foster the circular economy. In April 2020, Arkema presented its ambition to become a pure player and world leader in Specialty Materials by 2024, offering the most innovative and sustainable solutions to add ress its customers’ curren t and future challenges. The Group will notably leverage on its innovation and investments in major projects linked to new energies, lightweight, recycling, urbanization and mobility. Arkema’s solutions aim to allowing customers t o reduce their GHG emissio ns with the “Lightweight materials and design”, the “New energies” and the “Home efficiency and insulation” platforms. At the end of 2018, Arkema launched a Portfolio Sustainability Assessment , which is a systematic process to evaluate its solutions port folio (taking into account a product’s different applications and regions), in line with a methodological guide issued by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD ) . 9 To the extent permitted by the information available, the assessment takes into account the entire value chain, including manufacturing processes, from raw materials to the product’s end of life. In May 2020, A rkema became a member of the World Business Counci l for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). As Arkema ha d met its GH G reduction target ahead of time , a new target has been set in 2020 . The Issuer aims to reduce its absolute emissions by more than 1.7 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent compared to 2015 to reach less than 3 million metric tons in 2030, regardless of th e increase of its production volumes . This represents a decrease in GHG emissions of 38% by 20 30 . This new long - term Science - Based Target (SBT) is deemed consistent with the goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures to well below 2°C above pre - indust rial levels by the end of the century, in accordance with the Paris Agreement and recent repor ts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 9 World Business Council for Sustainable Development - Chemical Industry Methodology for P ortfolio Sustainability Assessments – October 2018 - https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Circular - Economy/Factor - 10/Sector - Deep - Dives/Resources/Chemical - Industry - Methodology - for - Portfolio - Sustainability - Assessments Coherent Partially coherent Not coherent,1 0 / 2 0 2 0 18 APPENDIX 1 – ISSUER ESG PERFORMANCE D O M A I N C O M M E N T S O P I N I O N Environment Arkema's performance in the Environment pillar is advanced . The Issuer’s formalised commitment to environmental protection covers all of its responsibilities and it has set targets regarding greenhouse gases emissions, VOC emissions, emissions to water and net energy purchases to be achieved by 2025 (2012 baseline). Most KPIs are on decreasing trends over the last five years, although not continuously, and are externally verified by Arkema's external auditor. The Company continues to implement an ISO14001 certified EMS at a maj ority o f its production sites and works on optimis ing its processes to reduce its environmental footprint. Arkema also implements innovative measures to treat its water discharges. The Company displays a strong commitment to prevent accidental pollution, s upporte d by extensive means. Arkema continues to report on efforts to develop bio - sourced chemicals, and this is part of the Issuer’s Innovation policy. C omprehensive means are allocated to Product safety, notably for its most toxic substances for which it studie s substitution solutions. Progresses are confirmed in the way the Issuer works to integrate environmental standards in its supply chain, in particular through its membership in 'Together for Sustainability', a sectorial initiative enabling pooling w ith oth er chemical companies to conduct supplier assessments and audits. Advanced Robust Limited Weak Social Arkema's performance in the Social pillar is advanced . Relevant means are reported to ensure Labour rights are promoted and guaranteed ac ross the company, and quantitative targets have been set to increase gender and national diversities at management level by 2025. In this regard, extensive measures are also in place to prevent discrimination and promote diversity, producing positive res ul ts in terms of gender diversity in particular. The Issuer's commitment to promote the social and economic development of the territories where it operates is formalised in its Human Rights Policy and its Social Commitment Charter. Besides, extensive mean s are developed: the company provides financial support for company creation or takeovers and prospects for the set - up of new activities to mitigate site closures, it also engages in social development programs and supports the creation and development of lo cal businesses. Its Common Ground® approach forms the basis of its community engagement actions. Arkema appears to have a solid culture of s ocial dialogue. It continued its significant efforts in career management and training, showing that a great major it y of employees benefit from training courses. The Company also sets specific targets to reduce injuries and means allocated in this view include a certified Health & Safety system. Various initiatives are also in place to deal with stress at work. Report ed KPIs show positive results. Advanced Robust Limited Weak Governance Arkema's performance in the Governance pillar is robust . Relevant internal controls are in place to address the Prevention of corruption and Anti - competitive practices, includin g due diligence on business partners and intermediaries. Arkema is registered on the EU Transparency Register and reports its overall lobbying budget and activities to EU Institutions . 54% of Directors serving on Arkema's Board and its C ommittees are consi dered independent and 45% of Directors are women . In addition, two employee representatives are sitting on Board. However, the roles of CEO and Chairman remain combined and Arkema is still only partially transparent on its Executive remu neration. Major vot ing rights restrictions also remain in the form of a voting rights ceiling. On the other hand, Arkema still generally demonstrates good corporate governance practices. Board members' performance is regularly evaluated by a third party, w ith disclosure of t he results. CSR issues also seem to be well integrated at top management level, with for example relevant processes dedicated to the management of CSR risks. The Group's safety record is one of the points considered in the qualitative cr iteria entering in the CEO's annual variable compensation and some Board members demonstrate CSR expertise. Advanced Robust Limited Weak,1 0 / 2 0 2 0 19 METHODOLOGY In Vigeo Eiris’ view, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors are intertwined and complementary. As suc h they cannot be separated in the assessment of ESG management in any organisation, activity or transaction. In this sense, Vigeo Eiris provid es an opinion on the Issuer’s ESG performance as an organisation, and on the processes and commitments applicable to the intended issuance. Our Second Party Opinions (SPOs) are subject to internal quality control at three levels (Project Manager, Quality Reviewer and final review and validation by a Senior Supervisor). A right of complaint and recourse is guaranteed to all companies under our review, following three levels: first, the team in contact with the company; then the Executive Director in charge of Methods, Innovation & Quality; and finally Vigeo Eiris’ Scientific Council.

ISSUANCE Alignment with the Green and/or Social Bond Principles S c a l e o f a s s e s s m e n t : N o t a l i g n e d , P a r t i a l l y a l i g n e d , Al i g n e d , B e s t P r a c t i c e s The Framework has been evaluated by Vigeo Eiris according to the ICMA’s Green Bond Principles - June 2018 (“GBP”) and on our methodology based on international standards and sector guidelines applicable in terms of ESG management and assessm ent. Use of proceeds The definition of the Eligible Projects and their sustainable objectives and benefits are a core element of Green/Soc ial/Sustainable Bonds and Loans standards. Vigeo Eiris evaluates the clarity of the definition of the Eligible Catego ries, as well as the definition and the relevance of the primary sustainability objectives. We evaluate the descriptions of the expected be nefits in terms of relevance, measurability and quantification. In addition, we map the potential contribution of Eli gible Projects to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals’ targets. Process for evaluation and selection The evaluation and select ion process is assessed by Vigeo Eiris on its transparency, governance and relevance. The eligibility criteria are as sessed on their clarity, relevance and coverage vs. the intended objectives of the Eligible Projects. Management of proceeds The process and rules for the management and the allocation of proceeds are assessed by Vigeo Eiris on their transparency, traceab ility and verification. Reporting The monitoring and reporting process and commitments defined by the Issuer are assessed by Vige o Eiris on their transparency, exhaustiveness and relevance, covering the reporting of both proceeds’ allocation and sustainab le benefits (output, impact indicators). Contribution to sustainability S c a l e o f a s s e s s m e n t : W e a k , L i m i t e d , R o b u s t , A d v a n c e d Vig eo Eiris’ assessment of activities’ contribution to sustainability encompasses both the evaluation of their expected positive impacts on environmental and/or social objectives, as well the management of the associated potential negative impacts and externa lities.,1 0 / 2 0 2 0 20 Expected positive impact of the activities on environmental and/or social objectives The expected positive impact of activities on environmental and/or social objectives to be financed by the Issuer or Borrower is assessed on the basis of: i) the relevance of the activity to respond to an important environmental objective for the sector o f the activity; or to respond t o an important social need at country level; 10 ii) the scope of the impact: the extent to which the expected impacts are reaching relevant stakeholders (i.e. the issuer, its value chain, local and global stakeholders); or ta rgeting those populations most i n need; iii) the magnitude and durability of the potential impact of the proposed activity on the environmental and/or social objectives (capacity to not just reduce, but to prevent/avoid negative impact; or to provide a str uctural/long - term improvement); iv) only for environmental objectives, the extent to which the activity is adopting the best available option. Activities' ESG risk management The identification and management of the potential ESG risks associated with the eligible projects/activities ar e analysed on the basis of Vigeo Eiris’ ESG assessment methodology, international standards and sector guidelines applicable in terms of ESG management and assessment. PART 2. ISSUER Issuer’s ESG performance S c a l e o f a s s e s s m e n t o f E S G p e r f o r m a n c e : W e a k , L i m i t e d , R o b u s t , A d v a n c e d NB: The Issuer’s level of ESG performance (i.e. commitments, processes, results of the Issuer related to ESG issues), has been assessed through a complete process of rating and benchmarking dev eloped by Vigeo Eiris. The Issuers ESG performance has been assessed by Vigeo Eiris on the basis of its: - Leadership : relevance of the commitments (content, visibility and ownership). - Implementation : coherence of the implementation (process, means, control/reporting). - Results : indicators, st akeholders’ feedbacks and controversies. Management of stakeholder - related ESG controversies A controversy is an information, a flow of information, or a contradictory opinion that is public, documented and tracea ble, allegation against an Issuer on corpor ate responsibility issues. Such allegations can relate to tangible facts, be an interpretation of these facts, or constitute an allegation based on unproven facts. Vigeo Eiris reviewed information provided by the Issuer, press content providers and stakeho lders (partnership with Factiva Dow Jones: access to the content of 28,500 publications worldwide from reference financial newspapers to sector - focused magazines, local publications or Non - Government Organizations ). Information gathered from these sources is considered as long as it is public, documented and traceable. Vigeo Eiris provides an opinion on companies’ controversies risks mitigation based on the analysis of 3 factors: - Frequency : reflects for each ESG c hallenge the number of controversies that t he Issuer has faced. At corporate level, this factor reflects on the overall number of controversies that the Issuer has faced and the scope of ESG issues impacted (scale: Isolated, Occasional, Frequent, Persisten t). - Severity : the more a controversy is rel ated to stakeholders’ fundamental interests, proves actual corporate responsibility in its occurrence, and have caused adverse impacts for stakeholders and the company, the higher its severity is. Severity assigne d at the corporate level will reflect the h ighest severity of all cases faced by the company (scale: Minor, Significant, High, Critical). - Responsiveness : ability demonstrated by an Issuer to dialogue with its stakeholders in a risk management perspective a nd based on explanatory, preventative, reme diating or corrective measures. At corporate level, 10 The importance of a specific social need at country level is assessed on the basis of the country performance on the priority SDG that the project is targeting using data from Sachs, J., Schmidt - Traub, G., Kroll, C., Lafortune, G., Fuller, G., Woelm, F. 2 020. The Sustainable Development Goals and CO VID - 19. Sustainable Development Report 2020. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.,1 0 / 2 0 2 0 21 this factor will reflect the overall responsiveness of the company for all cases faced (scale: Proactive, Remediate, Reactive, Non - Communicative). The impact of a controversy on a company's reputation re duces with time, depending on the severity of the event and the company's responsiveness to this event. Conventionally, Vigeo Eiris' controversy database covers any controversy with Minor or Significant severity d uring 24 months after the last event regist ered and during 48 months for High and Critical controversies. Involvement in controversial activities 17 controversial activities have been analysed following 30 parameters to screen the company's involvement in any of them. The company's level of involve ment (Major, Minor, No) in a controversial activity is based on: - An estimation of the revenues derived from controversial products or services. - The specific nature of the controversial products or services provided by the company.
