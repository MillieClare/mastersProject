This Second Party Opinion reflects our review of the uses and allocation of proceeds , and oversight and conformance of the bonds with the Green Bond Principles. In our opinion, the San Diego Unified School District General Obligation Bonds Series N - 1, Series N - 2 (“Series N Bonds”) , Series E - 1, Series E - 2 (“Series E Bonds”) , and the General Obligation Refunding Bonds Series ZR - 1 (“Series ZR - 1 Bonds”) ( and collectively, “Bonds”) are aligned with the four core components of th e Green Bond Principles and qualify for G reen B onds designation. ABOUT THE ISSUER The San Diego Unified School District (“ District ”) is a public school district that serves an area of 211 square miles, encompassing most of the populated portion of the City of San Diego ( “City”) in San Diego County (“County”) . The District is the second largest school district in the State of California with an estimated K - 12 enrollment as of October 2, 2020 , of 99,428 students (excluding charter school and preschool student s) .,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 2 The District is governed by a five - member Board of Education and is led by the Superintend ent of Public Education. T he District operates 108 elementary schools, 11 K - 8 schools, 24 middle/junior high schools, 22 senior high schools, 11 atypical/alternative schools, 17 s tate preschool sites, 4 special education centers , and is the sponsoring agency for 4 1 charter schools. The District ’ s sustainability goals are guided by Dream Big Ideas : Solutions for a Sustainable Future , adopted by the Board of Education on July 8, 2014. The report included 13 sustainability recommendations with the first being th e development of a districtwi de Climate Action Plan. The District ’s Climate Action Plan established a zero net energy goa l . As part of the Climate Action Plan, t he District has completed an emissions inventory and developed emissions reductions targets, as well as numerou s mitigation and adaptation strategies and goals. Existing targets and ongoing activities include : Achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2035 1 Install e fficient HVAC systems Perform LED lighting retrofits Achieve a 90% waste diversion rate by 2035 Complet e annual water efficiency fixture retrofits Convert two school buses to electric every year until 2035 The District has taken significant action toward reducing the environmental impact of facilities and operations. The District: Self - generate s approximat ely 45% of its electricity demand 2 Completed construction of 46 solar arrays 3 Adopted an anti - idling policy The District’s sustainability achievement s have also benefited from Proposition 39 (“Prop 39”) , the California Clean Energy Jobs Act that was adopted in 2013. Prop 39 provided statewide funding for educational facilities for energy efficiency upgrades and energy management projects. The District’s Prop 39 f inanced activities include energy storage, solar arrays, LED lighting, and automated thermostats to maximize heating and cooling efficiencies. ALIGNMENT TO GREEN STANDARDS Green Bonds are any type of bond instrument where the proceeds will be exclusively applied to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new and/or existing eligible Green Projects and which are aligned with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles (International Capital Market Association definition). Use of Proceeds The Bonds will be used to finance and refinance District - wide f acilities i mprovements that align with and support the District’s zero net energy goal . Financed and refinanced projects include energy efficiency improvements, photovoltaic installations, and construction and modernizations to facilities which meet green building standards (collectively “Facilities Improvements”). The Facilities Improvements are eligible project s as defined by the Green Bond Principles in the project categor y of Green Buildings . The Facilities Improvements all conform with the District’s goal to reac h zero net energy, C alifornia’s green building standards , and the Collaborati ve for High Performing Schools criteria for constructing and renovating facilities. Together, these three standards ensure the Facilities Improvements have positive environmental impacts and the District constructs and operates high - performance green buildings. 1 To advance the goal of 100% renewable electricity by 2035, the District has been a collaborator in San Diego’s Community Choi ce Aggregation Program. 2 By the end of 2021 3 18 systems are under construction and 12 will begin construction in 2021 Green Standard Eligible Project Categor y : ▪ Green Buildings,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 3 Zero Net Energy Goal: The District aims to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2035. To achieve this goal, the District is using a portion of Bond proceeds to finance installation of solar arrays and energy efficiency upgrades. Construction projects that meet strong green building standards to be financed and refinanced with the Bonds also align with the District’s zero net energy goal. CALGreen: California’s second largest source of greenhouse ga s emissions is the building sector. 4 To address the large opportunity for emission reductions from buildings, California maintains robust statewide green building codes. In 2007 , in response to Assembly Bill 32 (California Global Warming Solutions Act), t he S tate developed green building standards driven by the following objectives: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings Promoting environmentally responsible, cost - effective, healthier places to live and work Reducing water and energy consumption The Facilities Improvements meet the Green Building Standards Code, Part 11 of Title 24 of the Code of California Regulations. This code is also known as CALGreen and is the first statewide mandatory green building code in the United States. By following t hese efficient and responsible building design specifications, the District will conserve natural resources and help California meet its greenhouse gas reduction goals. California’s Green Building Standards Code specifies measures for sustainable planning and design, energy efficiency, water efficiency and conservation, material conservation and resource efficiency, and environmental quality. Combined, the standards encourage building concepts with positive environmental impacts, responsible water use, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental benefits include meeting greenhouse gas reduction targets, ensuring responsible site selection, diverting waste from landfills , and water conservation. Collaborative for High Performing Schools Criteria : In addition to the CALGreen standards and the overall mission to reach z ero n et e nergy , the District uses the Collaborative f or High Performing Schools (“CHPS”) criteria for certain construction activities. The District originally adopted CHPS construction standards in 2003 as a framework specifically designed for schools to expand construction of sustainable and healthy school s . CHPS assigns credits for achievements in the following categories: Integration, Indoor Environmental Quality, Energy, Water, Site, Materials & Waste, and Operations. A full list of potential c redits is provided in Appendix B . Proposition Z Projects The Series N Bond proceeds provide new money for Proposition Z , and the Series ZR - 1 Bond proceeds will be used to refund portions of an outstanding bond that financed Proposition Z projects. Th e Series N Bond proceeds will finance activities authorized in Proposition Z by voters in a November 6, 2012 , e lection. The Series N Bonds are the 14 th issuance in the $2.8 billion authorized by voters . There is no distinction between the activities financed by the Series N - 1 and Series N - 2 Bonds. The Series ZR - 1 Bonds will refund the San Diego Unified School Distr ict 2013 General Obligation Bonds (Dedicated Unlimited Ad Valorem Property Tax Bonds) (Election of 2012, Series C ) (“2013C Bonds”) that was part of the first issuance under the Proposition Z authorization. Anticipated projects to be financed by the Series N Bonds and refinanced by Series ZR - 1 Bonds include: Major campus renovations and new classroom buildings at 1 8 elementary schools, 5 middle schools and 6 high schools; Performing arts centers; Solar energy projects ; Charter school projects ; College career technical education projects; Classroom Technology and Technology Infrastructure ; and Major building systems replacement . 4 “Research on Green Buildings,” California Air Resources Board, accessed September 16, 2021, https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/research/research - green - buildings,Kestrel Verifiers | Second Party Opinion 4 Measure YY Projects The Series E Bond proceeds w ill finance activities authorized in the $3.5 billion Measure YY appro ved by voters in the November 6, 2018 , election.

Process for Project Evaluation and Selection Multiple stakeholders, procedures, and adopted planning documents inform decision - making regarding the bond - financed projects, including: the mission and strategic goals of Vision 2020 , Board of Education priorities , and the District’s primary sustainability p lan ( Dream Big Solutions for a Sustainable Future ) . The Bonds support the District’s Vision 2020 community - based school reform plan , with the mission to deliver high - quality education so students graduate with the skills, motivatio n, curiosity and resilience to succeed in their choice of college and career in order to lead and participate in society . 5 Developing schools as neighborhood learning centers is a primary strategic goal of Vision 2020 , and the Bonds directly advance this goal by financing facility projects and upgrades that will enhance learning and teaching environments . These bond - financed facilities projects and upgrades are part of the District’s capital improvements authorized by voters under Proposition Z and Measure YY. The Board of Education approved and implemented a phased plan for Proposition Z bond - financed project s through the District’s Facilities Planning and Construction Division . A n Independent Citizens’ Oversight Commi ttee , established by the Board and comprised of 13 volunteers , ensure s that taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately and monitors Proposition Z expenditu res. The District prioritizes projects based on facility conditions assessments and alignment with the Board of Education’s priorities which are : Safety and Security Drinking Water Quality Air Conditioning Solar Energy and Sustainability Provide Quality Teaching & Learning Environments . T he District ’s prioritization of bond - financed projects is further guided by th e District’s sustainability plan, Dream Big Solutions for a Sustainable Future , and its Climate Action Plan. Bond - financed projects advance certain goals and targets established in these in adopted planning documents , including : achieve zero n et energy , pursue energy efficiency upgrades and expand renewable energy generation capacity to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2035 .
