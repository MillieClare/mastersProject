TLCM has acted as an AM service provider for multiple renewable energy projects including solar power and wind power generation. TLCM set out the “Sustainability Policy” on June 1, 2018 and intends to continue to work on renewable energy projects aggressively in accordance with the policy. TLCM has established a green bond framework that provides practical guidelines for four standards of Green Bond Principles, etc. which concern the use of proceeds, process for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds, and reporting, and now considers issuing a green bond (trust certificate) and executing green loan (ABL) through a power generation SPC to raise funds to construct a solar power plant under development in Nogata City, Fukuoka in accordance with the framework. The issuance of the green bond takes the project finance scheme where a project is conducted through a dedicated special purpose company.

For details, please refer to https://www.r-i.co.jp/en/docs/policy/site.html. ©Rating and Investment Information, Inc. 【 R&I Green Bond Assessment 】 R&I has judged, in accordance with R&I Green Bond Assessment Methodology, that the proceeds from the green bond would be invested into projects with significant environmental benefits, and assigned GA1 (preliminary) to the green bond. This is a preliminary assessment and will be reassessed after the final confirmation of bond issuance details. 【 Second Opinion on the alignment with Green Bond Principles, etc. 】 R&I has also provided a second opinion that the green bond framework is aligned with Green Bond Principles 2018 1 and Green Loan Principles 2 (hereinafter collectively referred to as Green Bond Principles, etc.). Note that R&I has confirmed that the green bond scheduled to be issued is going to be in conformity to the said framework from the perspectives of issue amount and term, details of eligible projects, assets and investment schedule, etc. 【 Rationale 】  The entire proceeds from the issuance of the green bond will be used to construct a solar power plant under construction in Nogata City, Fukuoka, for which TLCM acts as AM service provider. The use of the proceeds is a renewable energy project that is expected to put less burden (CO2 emission reduction effect) on the environment and pays due consideration to environmental impact associated with the development, among other things. For these reasons, R&I has judged that the proceeds would be invested into a project with significant environmental benefits.  The selection of an eligible project for the green bond is proposed by a department in charge as well as Infrastructure Assets Investment Planning Department, and after discussing with multiple departments such as Compliance Department and Corporate Planning & Administration Department, to be approved in accordance with TLCM’s approval authority rules, including an approval by an officer in charge of Corporate Planning & Administration Department (President). It is an organizational selection process. In addition, the project is in conformity with TLCM’s Sustainability Policy.  The total amount of the project exceeds the proceeds from the issuance of the green bond. The proceeds are expected to be allocated generally within a year in accordance with the progresses of the work.  Unallocated proceeds shall be managed using a dedicated deposit account of the project SPC. Withdrawals shall be strictly managed and allowed only when conditions precedent (CP) are satisfied. Investors will be periodically updated with the progress of the project, while being sought approval of and reported on the allocation of the proceeds as needed.  The status of the proceeds allocation and reduced CO2 emissions for each project will be disclosed once a year on TLCM’s websites.  TLCM intends to provide services for renewable energy facility projects including solar power generation plants and wind power generation projects aggressively in accordance with the Sustainability Policy. 1 The 2018 edition of the Green Bond Principles (GBP) formulated and administered by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) 2 The Green Loan Principles (GLP) published by the Loan Market Association (LMA) and the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association (APLMA) in March 2018 and administered with the participation of the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA),NEWS RELEASE 4 ■ Contact : Sales and Marketing Division, Customer Service Dept.

Use of Proceeds For green bond proceeds to be used to invest in projects with environmental benefits, the eligible projects in which the funds are invested must be identified as being environmentally beneficial. Main basis for evaluation  Details of the framework  Confirmation of the details of eligible projects for the green bond Evaluation  Under the framework the proceeds will be allocated to pay the expenses to be incurred by a power generation SPC for a renewable energy project where TLCM acts as an AM service provider.  Eligible projects for this transaction are renewable energy (a solar power generation project this time) that are green-eligible assets from which sufficient environmental benefits (reduction in CO2 emissions) are expected.  R&I checked how TLCM intends to deal with the eligible projects as to whether or not 1) sufficient environmental benefits are expected from those projects, and 2) due consideration is paid to potential negative environmental impacts during the development and operational phases, through interviews and in writing.  With regard to the perspective of 1), it has been judged that they are expected to bring considerable environmental benefits (reduction in CO2 emissions) as eligible projects for the green bond in light of the review results of TLCM’s policies to determine the eligibility of a power plant, systems and track records as well as O&M systems among other things.  With respect to the perspective of 2), R&I has confirmed that environmentally-conscious steps, including obtaining necessary permits and licenses during the development and operational phases, have been taken, and judged that due consideration for potentially negative environmental impacts has been paid.  R&I has also confirmed its intention to expand the scope of the framework as needed when it is going to engage in renewable energy projects other than solar power generation projects. For the reasons stated above, R&I has judged the use of proceeds under the framework is in conformity to Green Bond Principles etc.,NEWS RELEASE 12 ■ Contact : Sales and Marketing Division, Customer Service Dept.

Process for Project Evaluation and Selection For green bond proceeds to be used to invest in projects with environmental benefits, the issuer's rationale and process regarding the selection of eligible projects must be clear and reasonable. Main basis for evaluation  Details of the framework  TLCM’s Philosophy and Sustainability Policy Evaluation  The eligible project is in conformity with TLCM’s Philosophy and Sustainability Policy.  The eligible project is expected to bring sufficient environmental benefits and paid due consideration for potentially negative environmental or social impacts.  The assessment and selection of a project goes through a pre-designated internal approval process (refer to page 12 for the concrete decision-making process for the project).

Also, in accordance with the details of the framework and specific measures to be taken for the green bond, R&I evaluated the extent the proceeds from the green bond are used to invest in businesses with environmental benefits. Project finance credit rating (preliminary) has also been assigned to the eligible projects of this transaction. Judging from the project feasibilities verified prior to assigning preliminary credit rating, the eligible projects are deemed to have sufficient environmental benefits. 1. Use of Proceeds  The eligible project for the green bond for the transaction is a solar power generation project which is under development in Nogata City, Fukuoka. Expenses to be incurred by a power generation SPC for the solar power generation plant, an eligible project under the framework, are designated to be in-scope, thus in line with the green bond framework.  R&I checked whether or not 1) sufficient environmental benefits are expected from the eligible projects, and 2) due consideration is paid to potential negative environmental impacts during the development and operational phase, similar to the assessment of the framework.  As a result, R&I has judged that the eligible project has sufficient feasibility and is expected to bring environmental benefits (reduction in CO2 emissions) in light of the securement of the project sites, its power generation facilities, contents of technical reports, and O&M systems, among other things. R&I has confirmed through project materials as well as field investigations that due consideration is paid for potential negative environmental impacts in development work and operations (surveys of the project sites and responses in accordance with the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act, existence of rare plants and animals, consideration to local residents, and so on) and concluded appropriate consideration for the environment is paid. For the reasons above, R&I deems that the extent to which the green bond proceeds are used to invest in projects with environmental benefits is especially excellent. 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection  The assessment and selection of an eligible project for the green bond is proposed by a department in charge and, after discussing with Compliance Department and others, to be approved by an officer in charge of Corporate Planning & Administration (President) in accordance with the framework stipulated by the issuer. It is judged as an organizational decision-making process with governance in place as multiple departments are involved and an approval by an officer is required.  R&I deems that the process for project evaluation and selection is very clear and reasonable. 3. Management of Proceeds  With respect to the green bond, R&I has confirmed that the proceeds are to be managed separately for the project in accordance with the framework stipulated by the issuer as well as the finance-related agreements.,NEWS RELEASE 15 ■ Contact : Sales and Marketing Division, Customer Service Dept.

This is because an issuer with higher interest in and more track records of environmental activities are more likely to allocate proceeds from a green bond to businesses with environmental benefits and get those businesses done.  TLCM has track records of acting as an AM service provider for multiple renewable energy projects including solar and wind power generation projects.  It works on ESG initiatives aggressively, by setting out the “Sustainability Policy” on June 1, 2018, signing on the “Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)” as well as obtaining a certification for DBJ Green Building at The Iceberg (Shibuya, Tokyo) held by a fund for which it acts as an AM service provider in 2019, and so on.  It intends to continue to engage in renewable energy projects aggressively in accordance with its Sustainability Policy.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF REVIEW and/or LINK TO FULL REVIEW (if applicable) [R&I Green Bond Assessment] R&I has judged, in accordance with R&I Green Bond Assessment Methodology, that the proceeds from the green bond would be invested into projects with significant environmental benefits, and assigned GA1 (fomal) to the green bond. [Second Opinion on the alignment with Green Bond Principles, etc.] R&I has also provided a second opinion that the green bond framework is aligned with Green Bond Principles 2018 and Green Loan Principles. For details, please refer to R&I Green bond assessment report above. Section 3. Detailed review Reviewers are encouraged to provide the information below to the extent possible and use the comment section to explain the scope of their review. 1. USE OF PROCEEDS Overall comment on section (if applicable) : ＜ Evaluation on the Green Bond Framework ＞ Under the framework the proceeds will be allocated to pay the expenses to be incurred by a power generation SPC for a renewable energy project where TLCM acts as an AM service provider. Eligible projects for this transa ction are renewable energy (a solar power generation project this time) that are green-eligible assets from which sufficient environmental benefits (reduction in CO2 emissions) are expected. R&I checked how TLCM intends to deal with the eligible projects as to whether or not 1) sufficient environmental benefits are expected from those projects, and 2) due consideration is paid to potential negative environmental impacts during the development and operational phases, through interviews and in writing. With regard to the perspective of 1), it has been judged that they are expected to bring considerable environmental benefits (reduction in CO2 emissions) as eligible projects for the green bond in light of the review results of TLCM’s policies to determine the eligibility of a power plant, systems and track records as well as O&M systems among other things. With respect to the perspective of 2), R&I has confirmed that environmentally-conscious steps, including obtaining necessary permits and licenses during the development and operational phases, have been taken, and judged that due consideration for potentially negative environmental impacts has been paid. R&I has also confirmed its intention to expand th e scope of the framework as needed when it is going to engage in renewable energy projects other than solar power generation projects. ＜ Evaluation on the Green Bond ＞ The eligible project for the green bond for the transaction is a solar power generation project which is under development in Nogata City, Fukuoka.

R&I checked whether or not 1) sufficient environmental benefits are expected from the eligible projects, and 2) due consideration is paid to potential negative environmental impacts during the development and operational phase, similar to the assessment of the framework. As a result, R&I has judged that the eligible project has sufficient feasibility and is expected to bring environmental benefits (reduction in CO2 emissions) in light of the securement of the project sites, its power generation facilities, contents of technical reports, and O&M systems, among other things. R&I has confirmed through project materials as well as field investigations that due consideration is paid for potential negative environmental impacts in development work and operations (surveys of the project sites and responses in accordance with the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act, existence of rare plants and animals, consideration to local residents, and so on) and concluded appropriate consideration for the environment is paid. For the reasons above, R&I deems that the extent to which the green bond proceeds are used to invest in projects with environmental benefits is especially excellent. Use of proceeds categories as per GBP: ☒ Renewable energy ☐ Energy efficiency ☐ Pollution prevention and control ☐ Environmentally sustainable management of living natural resources and land use ☐ Terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity conservation ☐ Clean transportation ☐ Sustainable water and wastewater management ☐ Climate change adaptation ☐ Eco‐efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes ☐ Green buildings (Environmentally Responsible Building) ☐ Unknown at issuance but currently expected to conform with GBP categories, or other eligible areas not yet stated in GBPs ☐ Other (please specify) : If applicable please specify the environmental taxonomy, if other than GBPs:,4 ■ Contact : Sales and Marketing Division, Customer Service Dept.

PROCESS FOR PROJECT EVALUATION AND SELECTION Overall comment on section (if applicable) : ＜ Evaluation on the Green Bond Framework ＞ The eligible project is in conformity with TLCM’s Philosophy and Sustainability Policy. The eligible project is expected to bring sufficient environmental benefits and paid due consideration for potentially negative environmental or social impacts. The assessment and selection of a project goes through a pre-designated internal approval process. It is an organizational selection process. For the reasons stated above, R&I has judged the process for project evaluation and selection under the framework is in conformity to Green Bond Principles etc. ＜ Evaluation on the Green Bond ＞ The assessment and selection of an eligible project for the green bond is proposed by a department in charge and, after discussing with Compliance Department and others, to be approved by an officer in charge of Corporate Planning & Administration (President) in accordance with the framework stipulated by the issuer. It is judged as an organizational decision-making process with governance in place as multiple departments are involved and an approval by an officer is required. R&I deems that the process for project evaluation and selection is very clear and reasonable. Evaluation and selection ☒ Credentials on the issuer’s environmental sustainability objectives ☒ Documented process to determine that projects fit within defined categories ☒ Defined and transparent criteria for projects eligible for Green Bond proceeds ☒ Documented process to identify and manage potential ESG risks associated with the project ☒ Summary criteria for project evaluation and selection publicly available ☐ Other (please specify): Information on Responsibilities and Accountability ☐ Evaluation / Selection criteria subject to external advice or verification ☒ In‐house assessment ☐ Other (please specify) :,5 ■ Contact : Sales and Marketing Division, Customer Service Dept.

MANAGEMENT OF PROCEEDS Overall comment on section (if applicable) : ＜ Evaluation on the Green Bond Framework ＞ The proceeds through the green bond will be managed at a dedicated account for the power generation SPC of the project and allocated to the relevant green project only. Therefore, the proceeds through each green bond will not be commingled with those for other projects. Withdrawals of the proceeds shall be strictly managed and allowed only when conditions precedent (CP) of relevant project finance agreements are satisfied. Unallocated proceeds will be kept in deposit which is a short-term liquid asset. Investors will be reported on the progress of the project and allocation of the proceeds as needed, which will be managed appropriately. For the reasons stated above, R&I has judged that the policy for management of proceeds under the framework is in conformity to Green Bond Principles etc. ＜ Evaluation on the Green Bond ＞ With respect to the green bond, R&I has confirmed that the proceeds are to be managed separately for the project in accordance with the framework stipulated by the issuer as well as the finance-related agreements. The total amount of the project exceeds the proceeds from the issuance of the green bond. The proceeds are expected to be allocated in accordance with the progresses of the work, which is expected to be completed generally within a year. R&I deems that the framework for managing the green bond proceeds is properly determined and especially excellent. Tracking of proceeds: ☒ Green Bond proceeds segregated or tracked by the issuer in an appropriate manner ☒ Disclosure of intended types of temporary investment instruments for unallocated proceeds ☐ Other (please specify) : Additional disclosure: ☒ Allocations to future investments only ☐ Allocations to both existing and future investments ☒ Allocation to individual disbursements ☐ Allocation to a portfolio of disbursements ☐ Disclosure of portfolio balance of unallocated proceeds ☐ Other (please specify) :,6 ■ Contact : Sales and Marketing Division, Customer Service Dept.

It will consist of fund allocation status reporting as well as impact reporting (the amounts of annual power generation as well as reduction in CO2 emissions) for each project for each series. It is reasonable in terms of contents. For the reasons stated above, R&I has judged that the policy for management of proceeds under the framework is in conformity to Green Bond Principles etc. ＜ Evaluation on the Green Bond ＞ R&I has confirmed that reporting for fund alloca tion status and environmental benefits for the green bond will be provided once a year on the company’s webs ites in accordance with the framework stipulated by the issuer.

Second Party Opinion : An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. 2. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. 3. Certification : An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. 4. Green Bond Scoring/Rating : An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2‐degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.
