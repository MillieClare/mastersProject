INTRODUCTION Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane SpA (Ferrovie) , together with its subsidiaries (Ferrovie Group) , provides transportation, infrastructure, real estate services, and other services in Italy and internationally. The Italy - based company was founded in 1905 and operates in four segments: - Transport for passenger and cargo through rail, road and sea; - Inf rastructure, including operation, maintenance , development, and use of railway network infrastructure; engineering services and construction of tunnels; - Real estate services , to manage and redevelop railway st ations and sell land and buildings ; - O ther servi ces , includ ing credit factoring, leasing, and consumer credit services; and certification, validation, and testing services on transport and infrastructure systems. Ferrovie Group ’s transportation segment operates in total 24,435 km of tracks, with 16,788 km of operational railway lines. Ferrovie has developed a Green Bond F ramework under which it will issu e multiple green bonds . The proceeds will be used to finance and refinance expenditures with the goal of improv ing the environmental performance of its operations and the attractiveness of trains for passenger transport in Italy . The net proceeds of each g reen b ond will be used to finance or re finance, in whole or in part, new projects or existing projects (refinancing may apply to project s dat ed back a maximum of two years ) to renew the firm’s Public Transport Rolling Stock . The Framework defines eligibility criteria in two areas: 1. New Electric Multiple Unit trains for regional passenger transport 2. New High - Speed Trains “ETR 1000” A list of eligible projects for the 2017 Green Bond issuance is provided in Appendix 1. Ferrovie engaged Sustainalytics to review its Green Bond F ramework and to provide a second - party opinion on the alignment of the F ramework with the Green Bond Principles 2017 (the “GBP”), as administered by the International Capital Market Association (the “ICMA”) . 1 As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Ferrovie Group ’s sustainability , finance and procurement team s to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds , as well as the management of proceeds and the reporting aspect s of Ferrovie’s G reen Bond F ramework . Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information . Following this engagement between Ferrovie and Sustainalytics, some elements of the Green Bond Framework were clarified to ensure alignment with the expect ations for disclosure reflected in the Gre en Bond Principles. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Ferrovie Green Bond Framework and should be read in conjunction with that framework. 1 ICMA’s Green Bond Principles 2017 https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/documents/Regulatory/Green - Bonds/GreenBondsBrochure - JUNE2017.pdf,© Sustainalytics 2017 4 2 SUSTAINALYTICS’ OPIN ION Section 1: Summary of Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Ferrovie Green Bond Framework • The eligible categories for the use of proceeds are aligned with those recognized by I CMA’s Green Bond Principles. Ferrovie disclosed a comprehensive level of detail for elig ible proj ects for each category. In Sustainalytics ’ opinion the use of proceeds provides a clear environmental benefit through the development of clean transportation and the accompanying reduction in GHG emissions from Italy’s public transport sector. Additional details on impact are provided in Section 3. • Following the assessment of Ferrovie’s sustainability strategy and the use of proceeds, Sustainalytics is of the opinion tha t the use of proceeds from the Green B ond will contribute to Ferrovie’s sustainability strategy and overall strategy to make trains, as a sustainable means of passenger transport, more attractive in Italy. For further details please see Section 2. • Ferrovie has a dedicated green bond working committee for project evaluation and selection, inc luding members of Ferrovie’s f inance and s ustainability teams and will be chaired by the company’s Head of Finance. On a semi - annual basis, t he committee will review eligible projects to identify projects that meet the eligibility c riteria . This is in line with recommended market practice. • Ferrovie will report on its website, on an annual basis, the allocation of the bond proceeds by eligible project category. In addition, an external auditor will ve rify the allocated proceeds to “Eligible Green P rojects ” a nd the remaining balance of unallocated proceeds on an annual basis . This information will be reported in Ferrovie’s annual report review. Th ese reporting practices are in line with market best practice. • Regarding impact reporting, Ferrovie will report to the extent possible on relevant impact metrics, such as GHG reduction, energy reduction and hazardous emission reduction. The reporting will be conducted for each eligible proj ect category on an annual basis and will be made available on Ferrovie’s website. Since the trains eligible for the use of proceeds are provided with energy measur ement systems , 2 Sustainalytics believes that the company is well positioned to report on relevant metrics. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 2017 : Sustainalytics has determined that the Ferrovie Green Bond aligns to the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2017. For detailed information please refer to Appendix B: Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. 2 Regional EMUs will have energy meter s; the ETR 1000 has a non - meter - based measurement system using voltage and cur rent measurement sensors present on the train .,© Sustainalytics 2017 5 Sect i on 2 : Assessment of Ferrovie’s sustainability strategy Contribution of the eligible projects to Ferrovie’s corporate and sustainability strategy As a provider of railway systems, passenger and cargo rail transport in Italy and internationally , Ferrovie Group plays an important part to improve the environmental performance of transport in Italy and the EU . Ferrovie integrated sustainability i nto its 2017 - 2026 business plan. The company also implemented an environmental policy and environmental manage m ent system , committing to reduce its environmental footprint regarding natural resources, energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity and other environmental impacts of its business, such as noise, electromagnetic and atmospheric emissions 3 . The company reports that in 2016, it started the process to fully integrate environmental management into its business model and intends to improve its sustainability performance and overall sustainability of transport through the following means : - R ed ucing its own consumption of natural capital by renewing the vehicle fleet, making buildings more energy efficient, building plants powered by renewable sources and purchasing certified green energy. - S ynergies between operators and technologies to promote a shift towards more efficient modes of transport . The company aims to decrease the amount of travel by private car and increase the use of mass transport by road, rail or both by offering a door to door service through combining different modes of transport , infrastructure, partnerships for car/ scooter/ bike sharing schemes and technology, such as an app that combines different modes of transport. Furthermore, Ferrovie is signatory o f the UIC Declaration on Sustainable Mobility & Transport . T he declaration provides guideline for repor ting on sustainability progress and includes 18 commitments on sustainable development, including environmental, social and ethical business topics. Sustainalytics believes that the “E ligible Green P rojects ” under the company’s G reen B o nd F ramework will contribute to the sustainability objectives and commitments made by Ferrovie in its 2017 - 2026 business plan and policies, thus contributing to Ferrovie’ s sustainability strategy. Well positioned to address common e nvironmental and social risks associated with the projects Main risks associated with the renewal of regional rolling stock and the use of high - speed trains for passenger transfer are t he potential negative impacts of noise on settlements and the environment, the degradation of biodiversity from land use for rail infrastructure , as well as the safety of passenger, persons crossing railroads and personnel on the trains. Environmental risk management To minimize negati ve environmental impacts of its operations, Ferrovie uses environmental impact assessments (EIA) and requires its contractors to have an environmental management system that aligns with ISO 14001 standards. For construction projects, contractors also need to carry out environmental 3 Ferrovie Environmental Policy, https://www.fsitaliane.it/content/fsitaliane/en/Sustainability/environmental - commitment/environmental - policy.html,© Sustainalytics 2017 6 analysis and identify material environmental impacts. Environmental inspections and periodic superv isory audits are conducted by the subsidiary I talferr, which serves as a technical supervisor . Ferrovie also reports on an analysi s of habitats to protect biodiversity and commits to mitigate noise from sites and stations, to implement permanent sound reduction fixtures and to explore other solutions to reduce the noise generated by train/track contact. Given Ferrovie’s use of envi ronmental impact assessments, its own environmental management standard and environmental requir ements for its contractors, Sustainalytics believes that the company is well positioned to manage environmental risks associated with the construction of new ra ilways and renewal of existing rolling stock . Safety management F errovie Group conducts social impact assessments, continuous community engagement and consultation throughout complex projects, providing adequate measures to minim ize negative impact on local communities. Regarding the safety of passenger services, Ferrovie Group has a Safety Management System that includes the following elements : - Ferrovi e Group invested 78% of its 2016 R&D spending 4 in traffic safety, and conducts accident analysis. - Ferrovie Group ’s Safety Management System includes train speed protection technologies and regular maintenance of railway infrastructure. The company i mprove s rail track safety th ro ugh decreasing the number of railroad crossings and improving safety of rai l road crossings, including new integrative automatic protection devices to detect obstacles on crossings. - Ferrovie ’s subsidiary Rete Ferroviaria Italiana - the infrastructure manager and the concessionarie of the Italian railway network - revised its quality and safety management procedures related to the maintenance of railway infrastructure in March 2016, to optimise decision - making, communication and information flows within these units. - Ferrovie’s subsidiary Trenitalia – the incumbent railway passenger transport operator - which will purchase the trains from the proceeds of the bonds , and b oth infrastructure subsidiaries RFI and Italferr , obtained external ISO 9001 certification for its quality management system 5 management . - The new regi onal EMUs, as well the HS ETR 1000, comply to the latest EU Technical Specification for Interoperability 6 (TSI) and are provided with modern and advanced signalling and control systems, ensuring a r easonably high level of safety. Based on the above, Sustai nalytics is of the opinion that Ferrovie Group has an adequate Safety Management System to mitigate safety related risks. 4 O verall R&D spending accounted for 0.51% of FY2016 revenues . 5 ISO 9001 is a certification for quality management systems for product or programmes. The standard ensures continuous quality improvement and that products and services meet customer’s requirements. https://www.iso.org/iso - 9001 - quality - management.html 6 The EU Technical Specification for Interoperability aim to foster the interoperability of the national networks by implementing a common rail safety approach to facilitate market access, while maintaining a reasonably high level of safety. Source: http://www.era.europa.eu/Document - Register/Pages/TSI - Application - Guide - general - part.aspx,© Sustainalytics 2017 7 Additionally, a s per Ferrovie Group 2016 Sustainability Report the number of safety inc idents 7 that occurred in 2016 demonstrate a downward trend in these incidents from previous years 8 , as well as some of the best performances in terms of number of safety incidents since 2006 . 9 As well, the Sustainability Report also mentions that r oughly 94% of these events in 2016 were due to reasons ouside the scope of the railway system. 10 Given this percentage and the adequate Safety Management System described above, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Ferrovie Group is well positioned to mitigate risks moving forward. Sectio n 3 : Impact of Use of Proceeds Ferrovie intends to use the proceeds for investments in renewal of its rolling stock including (i) the purchase of n ew Electric Multiple Unit trains for regional passenger transport and (ii) the purchase of “ETR 1000” high - speed trains. The use of proceeds categories are recognized as impactful by the GBP. In the following Sustainalytics will explain the local context. Impact of electric rail transit on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction In addition, a dvancing rail transportation is closely linked to achieving climate targets and to the EU - wide reduction targets for GHG emissions from transportation outlined in the “Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area . ” 11 The Commission aspires to meet these targets by priorit ising modes of transportation that can easily carry large numbers of passengers, such as rail, over cars. Advancing the rail transit is also likely to contribute to the Italy ’s GHG emission target of 40% reduction by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, given that t he transportation sector in Italy contributed 27.95% of I taly’s GHG emissions in 2012 . 12 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that improving long distant rail traffic, including an increase in speed, provides an incentive for passengers to travel b y train instead of car or plane, which are the main competing forms of transport for Trenitalia’s regional and high - speed trains. Given that , according to the European Environmental Age ncy, trains are the most energy efficient mode of passenger transport 13 7 As per Sustainalytics controversy research, the last significant railway accident in which Ferrovie was involved occ urred in 2009. The legal proceedings are still ongoing.

Page 104, https://www.fsitaliane.it/content/dam/fsitaliane/en/Documents/commitment/sustainability - report/archive/2016_FSItaliane_Sustainability_Report.pdf 11 The Roadmap envisages a reduction from the transport sector of at least 60% of GHG by 2050 with respect to 1990, and an interim target for 2030 of reducing GHG emissions to around 20% below 2008 levels. Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area. 2011 White Paper . Accessed September 9, 2016: http://eur - lex.europa.eu/legal - content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52011DC0144 12 https://unfccc.int/files/ghg_emissions_da ta/application/pdf/ita_ghg_profile.pdf 13 https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/ENVISSUENo12/page027.html,© Sustainalytics 2017 8 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the advancement of the regional and high - speed trains in Italy can have a great contribution to achieving the EU and Italian GHG reduction targets. Energy efficiency improvements compared to previous models While rail transport is the most energy efficient mode of passenger and freight transport in the EU, effi cienc y improvements of trains and the use of electric trains can contribute to further reduce GHG emissions by the transport sector. The eligible projects for regional and high - speed trains both demonstrate energy efficiency improvements compared to previous models. For the regional trains, Trenitalia in its tenders included energy efficiency into its selection criteria and selected trains with improved energy performance c ompared to train models currently used in Italy and by Trenitalia through lightweight materials, energy efficient ventilation , cooling systems and interior electronic equipment, such as lighting. Furthermore, t he ETR 1000 high - speed train has shown an average energy efficiency improvement of about 18% compared to the previous model ETR 500. In addition, the ETR 1000 has a recyclability rate of 94 . 4% and a recoverability rate of 95 . 8% 14 , reduc ing the life - cycle impact of the trains . T he regional trains have a minimum recyclability and recovery rate of 92% and 95%, respectively. While the energy efficiency improvements declared by the train manufacturers still need to be proven on ce the trains are in operation, g iven the declared energy improvements of the new electric trains compared to previous models, as well as recyclability of the trains, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the use of proceeds contributes to increased sustainability and energy efficiency of Ferrovie Group ’s operations and the mobility system in Italy . Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. These goals are widely considered the next step to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), which were time - bound to 2015 . The bon d’s use of proceeds contributes to the following SDGs: U se o f P roceeds Category SDG SDG target • E lectrical regional trains • High - Speed trains “ETR 1000” 11 . Sustainable Cities 11.2 By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons . • Electrical regional trains • High - Speed trains “ETR 1000” 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns 12.2 By 2030, ach ieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources 14 http://environdec.com/en/Detail/epd453,© Sustainalytics 2017 9 Conclusion Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane SpA (Ferrovie), wh ich provides through its subsidiaries transportation and infrastructure services in Italy and internationally, intends to issue green bonds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, investments to develop clean transportation and reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector . Proceed s of the bonds may be directed towards the following “Eligible Green Projects”: (i) purchase a nd put into commercial operation of Electric Multiple Unit trains for regional transport ; and (ii) purchase and put into commercial operation of the ETR 1000 high - speed train. Having reviewed Ferrovie ’ s Green Bond Framework and sustainability strategy, Sustainalytics beli e ves that the use of proceeds is well aligned with the company’s aim to promote clean transportation and that they will contribute to the GHG reduction targets set by Italy and in the EU Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area, as well as SDG 11 a nd 12 . The eligible categories for the use of proceeds are also aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond Principle s. The company’s management of the bond proceeds and reporting are aligned with market practices. To manage the bond ’ s proceeds, Ferrovie has a dedicated green bond working committee, i ncluding members of Ferrovie Group finance and s ustainability teams, which will evaluate and select projects on a semi - annual basis . The allocation of the bond proceeds by eligible project category will be reported on an annual basis on Ferrovie’s website. An external auditor will verify the allocated proceeds to “ Eligible G reen P rojects ” and the remaining balance of unallocated proceeds on an annual basis, disclosed in Ferrovie’s annual report review. Furthermore, Ferrovie will disclose relevant impact metrics on an annual basis per eligible category. Sustainalytics believes tha t the company’s effort to measure and disclose impact metrics are also in line with market best practice. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Ferrovie is well positioned to issue green b onds, and that the Ferrovie Green Bond Framework is robust and transparent and in alignment with the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2017.,© Sustainalytics 2017 10 APPENDICES Appendix 1 : Eligible P rojects Regional trains: 1) Purchase and put into commercial operation of the new regional electric train M edium C apacity: the latest generation product by Alstom called New EMU Alstom ( named “ Pop ” ) The main features of the new Alstom convoy that contribute to the reduction of energy consumption are: • best weight/ space ratio thanks to a wide use of aluminium ; • i mpro ved torque characteristic s b oth in traction and in electric braking; • internal lighting based on LED technology ; • low energy consumption during parking; • use of natural ventilation for cooling (engines, braking resistance, etc). In addition, to optimize the energy co nsumption of auxiliary services of the traction, the following technological solutions have been implemented: • engines with natural ventilation , with consequent elimination of the consumption produced by the forced ventilation system; • braking system cooled by natural convection, with consequent elimination of the power consumption of the forced ventilation system; • cooling of the power modules of each traction unit with a forced ventilation system : the heat sink of the power modules is invested by a cu rrent of air sucked by the fan installed on board the cash drives the traction converter; the same air flow is used to cool down the mains filter inductor adjacent to the drive case; it is thus possible to use a single fan for cooling of each tracti on unit s, with benefit in terms of energy consumption; • using deco upling inductances to natural ventilation. 2) Purchase and put into commercial operation of the new regional electric train High C apacity: latest generation of electric traction product from Hitachi (named “ Rock ” ). The main technical adaptations for the reduction of energy consumption of the new Hitachi convoy are: • reduction of the tare weight of the vehicle using "light" materials and optimizing the sizing of the main structures and components; • maximization of usable space; • CO 2 sensors for optimal regulation of heating and cooling ventilation based on vehicle actual occupation ; • materials with thermic insulation or, with reduced dimensions and weights; • low energy consumption during parking ; • internal lighting based on LED technology ;,© Sustainalytics 2017 11 With regard to the traction chain : • engines with natural ventilation, with consequent elimination of the consumption produced by the forced ventilation system; • traction inverter single - stage IGBT , with benefit in terms of energy consumption and efficiency; • efficient cooling systems for converter ; • dual cooling system speed to reduce st andstill consumption. High - speed train ETR 1000 (named “Frecciarossa 1000”) : The F recciarossa 1000 has introduced a series of technological improvements over the ETR 500 targeted to minimize the consumption of energy such as: a significant recourse to the use of light alloys, which allow to significantly reduce the overall weight, the u se of transformers and more efficient converters and an aerodynamic design also optimized to the smallest details .,© Sustainalytics 2017 12 Appendix 2 Green Bond Programme External Review Form Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form Green Bond / Green Bond Programme External Review Form Section 1.
