Green Bond 2 Introduction Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation’s (SMBC) , its wholly owned subsidiary, have developed a Green Bond Framework that allows both SMFG and SMBC respectively issue G reen B onds . P roceeds of the Green Bonds issued would be used to finance and refinance expenditures related to renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings, clean transportation, and pollution prevention and control. SMFG / SMBC engaged Sustainalytics to review its Green Bond Framework and provide a second - party opinion on the alignment of the green bond with the Green Bond Principles 2018 (the “GBP”), as administered by the International Capital Market Association (the “ICMA”) , 1 and the framework’s environmental cre dentials. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of SMFG and SMBC ’s corporate sustainability team and treasury team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceed s, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of their green bond s . Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains two sections: Framework Overview – summary of SMFG/SMBC ’s Green Bon d Framework ; and Sustainalytics’ Opinion – an opinion on the Green Bond framework. Overview of Issuer SMFG is the holding company of SMBC Group, which is one of the three largest banking groups in Japan and SMBC is the main operating bank. SMFG is designated a “global systemically important bank (G - SIB)” in recognition of its broad range of financial services in both domestic and overseas markets. In the co nduct of its business activities, SMBC Group aims to contribute to the sustainable development of our society by offering higher added value to (1) customers, (2) shareholders and the market, (3) the environment and society, and (4) employees. SMBC Group identifies Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as the foundation of the group’s business strategies, with a particular focus on “Environment”, “Next Generation” and “Community” as core components of its CSR activities. Environmental activity of the Group is typically categorised into three pillars: i) promoting environmental business, ii) managing environmental risk, and iii) reducing environmental impact. With regards to the environment initiatives i) and ii) above, SMBC adopted the Equator Principles in 2005 and has since set its internal procedures to assess the social and environmental risks arising from large - scale project finance. Based on this environmental and social risk management framework, SMBC extends environmental business loans and projec t finance loans, including loans for renewable energy projects which are diversified in terms of types and area. SMBC was named the Sustainable Bank of the Year Asia 2013 ; making SMBC the first Japanese bank to receive this prestigious award. In order to accelerate the Group’s environmental initiatives, SMBC issued its debut Green Bond in October 2015 – the USD - denominated Green Bond which marked the first offering by a Japanese private financial institution. Subsequently, SMFG issued its inaugural Green B ond – the first Green Bond offering in accordance with Green Bond Guidelines 2017 established by the Ministry of the Environment, Japan. The Group’s commitment to its environmentally friendly investments is reflected in the Group’s plan to continue Green B ond issuance in years to come. The criteria for the Eligible Green Projects are outlined in the Framework Overview section below. Framework Overview 1 ICMA’s Green Bond Principles 201 8 https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. Green Bond 3 For the purpose of issuing multiple green bonds, SMFG and SMBC ha ve de veloped the following framework which addresses the four key components of the Green Bond Principles (GBP): use of proceeds, project evaluation and selection process, management of proceeds, and reporting. The framework belongs to SMFG and SMBC , and a summary overview has been provided below. Use of Proceeds The proceeds of the green bond will be allocated towards financing and refinancing projects that meet the following eligibility criteria. Eligibility Criteria In cases where SMFG acts as the Issuer of a Green Bond, SMFG will extend an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of Green Bonds to SMBC as an inter - group loan. As a recipient of Green Bond proceeds from SMFG or in cases where SMBC is the Issuer of a Green Bond, SMBC will allocate an amount equal to th e net proceeds to finance, in whole or in part, existing and future qualifying environmentally - related projects (“Eligible Green Projects”) as defined by the internal investment criteria specified below. “Eligible Green Project” will meet all of the three conditions i), ii) and iii) below. i) A project is in one or more of the Project Categories (a) to (e) below a. RENEWABLE ENERGY The development, construction and operation of facilities that generate or transmit renewable energy, including: solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, biomass energy ( restricted to sustainable feedstock and / or waste materials ) and small run - of - river hydro facilities (generation capacity of 25 megawatts or less). b. ENERGY EFFICIENCY Energy - conservation equipment, i ncluding, but not limited to, LED lighting, efficient HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning), building insulation and energy demand control systems which improve energy efficiency. Projects that meet category (c) below are excluded from this cat egory (b) in order to avoid double counting. c. GREEN BUILDINGS New building construction or existing building retrofits which meet regional, national or internationally recognized third - party verified green building certifications, such as “LEED” (Leadershi p in Energy and Environmental Design), “BREEAM” (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology) or “CASBEE” (Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency) to a level s of at least “LEED Gold”, “BREEAM Excellent” , o r “CASBEE A Level”. d. CLEAN TRANSPORTATION Expenditure that supports the shift to clean energy vehicles (including electric vehicles and supporting infrastructure) and the development, operation and upgrade of public transportation facilities (including improvement to rail transport, bicycles and other non - motorised transport). e. POLLUTION PREVENTION & CONTROL Waste recycling: Development, construction and/or operation of recycling facilities for municipal and industrial waste . Waste to energy: Development, construction and/or operation of waste to energy power plant s . ii) A project is categorized as Category B or Category C under the Equator Principles as published by the Equator Principles Association, and,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. Green Bond 4 iii) An exis ting or new project which SMFG (or, SMBC, as the case may be) has agreed to lend (a) during the 24 months prior to the relevant issue date of a Green Bond or (b) after the issue date of a Green Bond but before the relevant maturity date of such Bond. Excl usionary Criteria For clarification purposes, the following are excluded from SMFG/SMBC ’s Green Bond Framework: fossil fuel based assets, fossil fuel based transportation / infrastructure and transportation with the main objective of transporting fossil f uel, defen s e and security, palm oil, wood pulp, nuclear power generation, coal - fired power generation as well as all mining and tobacco sectors. Project Evaluation and Selection Process Application of Eligibility and Exclusionary Criteria in Project Selection SMFG’s Corporate Treasury Department and SMBC’s Planning Department, Treasury Unit worked together with SMFG’s Corporate Sustainability Department to establish the criteria for Eligible Green Projects, including Project Categories (a) to (e) above, in conj unction with the support provided by The Japan Research Institute (JRI), the think tank subsidiary of the group with extensive experience and knowledge in environmental fields. In cases where SMFG acts as the Issuer of a Green Bond, SMFG’s Corporate Treasu ry Department manages the process of lending the net proceeds to SMBC in a form of an inter - group loan. SMBC’s Structured Finance Department selects the projects which meet the criteria. SMFG’s Corporate Treasury Department and SMBC’s Planning Department, Treasury Unit decide the eligible project for the green bond. Net proceeds of the green bond are to be allocated to selected eligible projects. Environmental Objectives SM BC Group is committed to incorporating CSR initiatives into its business strategy, 2 and identifies three key CSR initiatives that are important to the company: 3 Environment, Next Generation, and Community. With respect to the environmental initiatives, the group wide environmental policy 4 is aimed at contributing to sustainable society w ith a focus on the preservation of the global environment. It s environmental policy has laid out its commitment within eight pillars: 1) promoting environmental themed products, information and services, 2) reducing environmental risks, 3) s aving resources and energy and reducing waste, 4) complying with environmental laws and regulations, 5) disclosing environmental relevant information, 6) engaging with employees, 7) setting out objectives and goals each financial year, and 8) disclosing the envi ronmental policy on its corporate website. To support its environmental policy, the group also identifies the priority environmental initiatives including the promotion of environmental businesses. The SMFG /SMBC ’s Green Bond Framework contributes to pillar 1 of it s environmental policy. Process to Mitigate Environmental and Social Risks Each project finance transaction undergoes a credit evaluation by SMBC’s S tructured F inance D epartments. SMBC’s Structured Finance Departments also initiate the environmen tal screening process by completing the “Environment Screening Form” which is in turn further examined by SMBC’s Environment Analysis Department. This department assesses social and environmental risk of the relevant projects and categorize projects into c ategories in accordance to the Equator Principles. The Environment Analysis Department’s review of each Project Finance transaction constitutes an important component of the decision - making process. Based on the review, covenants in the financing agreeme nt will include environmental and social considerations and compliance will be monitored during the life of the loan. Should a project fail to meet the required standard on environmental and social metrics, then SMBC would request for an improvement as (a syndicate of) financing banks.

Green Bond 5 SMBC Group has established and implemented systems designed to monitor and ensure the allocation of net proceeds from its Green Bonds will be allocated to Eligible Green Projects as defined above. Records will show an amount equal to the net proceeds from Green Bonds are allocated to assets that meet SMFG/SMBC’s criteria of Eligible Green Projects. Pending allocation to Eligible Green Projects, the net proceeds will be invested in overnight or other short - term financial instruments. Any of Green Bond proceeds allocated to projects that have been sold, prepaid, amortised or have otherwise become ineligible will be reallocated to other Eligible Green Projects. Also, payment of the principal and intere st on the Green Bonds will be made from SMFG/SMBC’s general funds and will not be directly linked to the performance of any of the Eligible Green Projects. Reporting Allocation Reporting During the term of any relevant Green Bond, SMFG / SMBC will provide and keep readily available, on a dedicated website, information on the allocation of the net proceeds of the Green Bonds. This information will be updated at least annually until full allocation and as necessary thereafter in the event of new devel opments. This information shall include: • the allocation of Green Bond proceeds to Eligible Green Projects, detailing the Eligible Green Projects funded, current funded amounts and initial funding dates , a nd • assertions by m anagement that the net proceeds of the Green Bond are invested either in qualifying Eligible Green Projects or in overnight or other short - term financial instruments. Impact Reporting In addition, SMFG / SMBC will annually publish on a dedicated website information and assessments relating to the environmental impacts of financed Eligible Green Project s. SMFG/SMBC intend to report on the tons of CO 2 emission equivalent , amount of energy saved (kwh), or amount of waste recycled (tons) dependi ng on project categories. The environmental impacts of financed Eligible Green Projects, where reported, may be calculated on a collective basis. These estimated environmental impacts will be calculated in conjunction with support from JRI. Compliance Re view Before the first anniversary of the green bond issuance, SMFG / SMBC will engage Sustainalytics to review the lending financed by the green bonds in order to assess the compliance of the lending with its Green Bond Framework. This review will be conducted annually until full allocation of the net proceeds from the Issuer’s green bond . Sustainalytics will provide a report of the review, which SMFG / S MBC will publish on its website. In an unlikely event that the annual review identifies allocations made to activities that do not comply with the SMFG /SMBC ’s Green Bond Framework , SMFG / SMBC will allocate the corresponding amounts to different lending acti vities that are compliant with its Green Bond Framework .,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. Green Bond 6 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. / Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation ’s Green Bond Framework Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that SMFG/SMBC ’s Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 201 8 . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of the green bond framework : • Use of Proceeds: - Renewable Energy, Clean Transportation, Energy Efficiency, Green Buildings, and Pollution Prevention and Control are recognized by the Green Bond Principles as project categories with clear environmental benefit s ; - SMFG / SMBC intend to allocate the proceeds in hydropower projects by limiting to small run - of - river facilities generation capacity of 25 megawatts or less and for biomass energy projects by limiting to sustainable feedstock and waste sources. Sustainalytics view s this as s t rengthening the framework. - Under energy efficiency projects, Sustainalytics recognizes that market standard is to set the minimum threshold for energy efficiency improvements and as such Sustainalytics recommends SMFG / SMBC to set specific energy efficienc y improvement targets to further strengthen the framework . - The Green Buildings eligibility criterion for new buildings or retrofitted existing buildings is based on the thi rd - party certification standard LEED , BREEAM and CASBEE, with a focus on the second highest level of certifications (Please see Appendix 1 for our assessment) . Sustainalytics considers a focus on the top two levels of certification for LEED, BREEAM and CASBEE to be in line with market best practice. • Project Selection Process: - El igible projects are reviewed and selected by SMBC’s Structured Finance Department based on eligibility criteria , and the decision will be made by SMFG’s Corporate Treasury Department and SMBC’s Planning Department . This is in line with market standard. • Ma nagement of Proceeds: - The proceeds of the green bond will be monitored by an internal system that ensures an amount equal to the net proceeds from Green Bonds to be allocated to assets that meet SMFG /SMBC ’s criteria of Eligible Green Projects . This is in line with market standard. • Reporting: - SMFG / SMBC are committed to reporting on information including the allocation of the proceeds, details of the projects funded, current funded amounts, initial funding dates and contractual maturity dates , annually on its website. In addition , SMFG / SMBC intend to receive assertions by management to confirm that the proceeds are invested in eligible projects or in financial instruments. Sustainalytics considers receiving management’s assertion is in line with market best practice. - Impact reporting will include environmental impact indicators such as the tons of CO2 emission equivalent, amount of energy saved (kwh), or amount of waste recycled (tons) , which is in line with market standard . Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 Sustainalytics h as determined that the Issuer’s g reen b ond aligns to the four core component s o f the Green Bond Principles 2018 .

Green Bond 7 Alignment with Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2017 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the SMFG /SMBC’s Green Bond Framework are in line with the ICMA Green Bond Principles. In addition, t he Japanese Green Bond Guidelines communicate what an issuer should do to issue a credible green bond, and also highlight what an issuer is recommended to do. Sustainalytics assessed the alignment between SMFG/SMBC’s Green Bond Framework and the requirements of’ items outlined in the Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines. ICMA Green Bond Principles and Japan’ s Green Bond Guidelines, 2017 5 Alignment with GBP and with Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines? Sustainalytics’ comments on alignment with Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines. 6 1. Use of Proceeds Yes Eligible project categories (Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, Green (Energy Efficient) Buildings, Clean Transportation, and Pollution Prevention and Control) in the SMFG /SMBC ’s Green Bond Framework are outlined with clear details and are recognized by Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines as providing clear envir onmental benefit. SMFG / SMBC also identif y social and environmental risk (any potential negative impact) associated with the eligible projects, and explains how they manage the risk through the application of the Equator Principles. 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection Yes SMFG /SMBC ’s Green Bond F ramework well describes information, required by Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines, on 1) “Environmental sustainability objectives” (In this report: Environmental Objectives), 2) “Criteria” for evaluating an d selecting specific green projects (in this report: “Eligibility and Exclusionary Criteria” and “Application of Eligibility Criteria in Project Selection”), and 3) “Process” to evaluate and select E ligible G reen P rojects (In this report: “Process to Mitigate Environmental and Social Risks” and “Application of Eligibility Criteria in Project Selection”). 3. Management of Proceeds Yes SMFG /SMBC ’s Green Bond F ramework clarifies that SMFG / SMBC manages proceeds by 1) keeping the list of all Eligible Green Project loans based on SMFG’s internal system, 2) recoding the amount of the allocated and unallocated proceeds (which will be invested in short term financial instruments) to match to the tota l proceeds allocated by the green bond, and 3) making sure that the proceeds are tracked and managed, which are all followed by Japan’s Green 5 Green Bond Guidelines, 2017, Summary, Ministry of the Environment, Japan: https://www.env.go.jp/en/policy/economy/gb/summary2017.pdf 6 For detailed comments on alignment with ICMA GBP, please see Appendix .,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. Green Bond 8 Bond Guidelines. SMFG / SMBC explains this to green bond investors. 4. Reporting Yes SMFG /SMBC ’s Green Bond F ramewo rk clearly commits to disclose the five items annually, which are required by Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines: List of projects that have been allocated, brief description of projects, amount allocated, environmental benefits, and information on unallocated proceeds. Section 2: Sustainability Performance of the Issuer Contribution of framework to issuer’s sustainability SM BC Group (that include s SMFG and SMBC) states that its CSR is the foundation for it s business strategies. 7 SM BC Group manages its CSR strategy based on its CSR policy and three material issues: “Environment”, “Next Generation” and “Community.” In addition, the group sets out an environmental vision and policy, as well as key environmental initiatives which aim to preserv e and improve the global environment th r ough its core business activities. 8 As described in the SMFG /SMBC ’s Green Bond Framework, the group ’s environmental policy has eight pillars. SM BC Group ’s policy is also integrated in its business activities as it states that it promotes environment themed products and services. For example, SMBC, as one of main group company, has provided environment - themed financial products and services such as environmental assessment loans, and project finance for renewable ene rgy businesses. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the integration of the group ’s environmental policy in SMFG / SMBC’s business activities could be strengthened by adding quantitative and timebound targets with respect to promoting environmentally impact ful products and financing environmentally impactful projects. Overall, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that SMFG / SMBC ha ve a strong environmental policy that is integrated in its business activities, and the SMFG /SMBC ’s Green Bond Framework contributes to pillar 1 of the environmental policy, “promoting environmental themed products, information and services.” Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects Overall, Sustain alytics is of the opinion that SMFG / SMBC are well positioned to manage key environmental and social risks associated with the SMFG Green Bond projects. Some key environmental and social risks associated with projects are utilization of viable forest or foo d products as biomass, and worker safety and pollution control in construction and development projects. The strength of SMFG / SMBC ’s risk management is based on the following: • SMFG / SMBC have stated to Sustainalytics its commitment to restrict to sustainab le feedstock and waste sources as biomass for energy production , which mitigates the risks of deforestation and competition with food sources described above. • The Equator Principles (EP), which apply to four financial products including project finance, project related corporate loans, are commonly widely accepted as credible standard and widely used by worldwide financial institutions. SMFG is committed to asse ssing social and environmental risk of relevant projects based on EP, which demonstrates its robust system to contribute to environment and social risk mitigation. • The Environment Analysis Department assesses social and environmental risk of relevant proj ects, and categorize projects in accordance to the Equator Principles. Covenants in the financing agreement will include environmental and social considerations as a result of review, and compliance to the EPs will be monitored during the life of the loan. 7 CSR at SMFG, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group http://www.smfg.co.jp/english/responsibility/smfgcsr/ 8 Promoting Environmental Businesses, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group http://www.smfg.co.jp/english /responsibility/environment/business/,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. Green Bond 9 Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All five use of proceeds categories are recognized as impactful by GBP. Sustainalytics has focused on two below where the impact is specifically relevant in local context. Impact of renewable energy , energy efficie ncy and clean transportation in Japan The energy self - sufficiency ratio of Japan is low especially compared to OECD countries, 9 in which Japan imports about 84% of energy. 10 The energy source that Japan heavily depended on before the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 was nuclear power which Japan had set as a national strategic priority since 1973. 11 However, it became necessary for Japan to revise its energy mix and strategi c plan after the c ountry experienced an accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plan and subsequent shutdown of nuclear plants across Japan due to residents’ concerns. In the new strategic plan, the target of renewable energy including wind, solar, geotherma l, biomass and hydro is set at 22 - 24% by 2030 – a significant increase from 1 0 % before the earthquake. Given the Japan’s small ratio of energy self - sufficiency and national strategic plan to tackle the global warming through the promotion of renewable ener gy, it is clear that the demand in renewable energy will increase and there will be growing needs to finance the construction and operation renewable energy facilitates in Japan. As well the strategic plan indicates that improvement of energy efficiency by approx. 50.3 billion liters (crude oil equivalent) in 2030 is essential in order to achieve the energy mix. 12 Moreover, the transport sector accounts for 18.8% of Japan’s CO 2 emissions, according to 2016 data. 13 While the country reduced its GHG emissions from the sector by 3.8% between 2016 and 2013, 14 further investments in clean transportation projects are needed to support Japan’s transition towards a low - carbon economy and achieve its GHG reduction targets. Importanc e of green building in climate change mitigating in Japan According to Japan’s Ministry of Land Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, 15 meeting the energy demand has become increasingly challenging since the Great East Japan earthquake. In addition, the en ergy consumption from building sector has been significantly increasing, and the building sector itself consists of one third of whole energy use in Japan. 16 Because of the growing demand and consumption of energy from the building industry, the government places an emphasis on the building energy efficiency while reestablishing the new Building Energy Efficiency Act in 2017, in which the construction of certain size of buildings are required to meet the energy efficiency standards or notify the administrative agency with jurisdiction if the requirement cannot be met. 17 In a ddition, as part of the Japan’s plan to achieve its c ommitments on CO 2 targets for Paris Agreement, the government promotes the conformity with the energy efficiency standards s et by the Act along with other initiatives including the growth of green building certification system such as CASBEE. 18 Given the above context, there is a clear need in Japan for buildings to be energy efficiency, reflected in the significant consumptions and priority set by a national strategy. 9 Japan's Energy, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, Japan http://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/en/category/brochures/pdf/japan_energy_2016.pdf 10 Nuclear Power in Japan, World Nuclear Association http://www.world - nuclear.org/information - library/country - profiles/countries - g - n/japan - nuclear - power.aspx 11 Nuclear Power in Japan, World Nuclear Association http://www.world - nuclear.org/information - library /country - profiles/countries - g - n/japan - nuclear - power.aspx 12 Directions in New Energy Efficiency Policy, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry http://www.meti.go.jp/shingikai/enecho/shoene_shinene/sho_energy/pdf/017_02_00.pdf 13 Japan’s National Greenhous e Gas Emissions in Fiscal Year 2016 (Preliminary Figures) https://www.env.go.jp/press/files/en/750.pdf 14 Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global - greenhouse - gas - emissions - data 15 Overview of the Act on the improvement of Energy Consumption Performance of Buildings (Building Energy Efficiency Act), Minis try of Land Infrastru cture, Transport and Tourism, Japan https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001134876.pdf 16 Overview of the Building Energy Efficiency Act, Ministry of Land Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan http://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001178846.pdf 17 Overview of the Act on the improvement of Energy Consumption Performance of Buildings (Building Energy Efficiency Act), Ministry of Land Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001134876.pdf 18 Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures (Japan ese), Ministry of Environment, Japan https://www.env.go.jp/press/files/jp/102816.pdf,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. Green Bond 10 Importance of Pollution Prevention and Control Japan has an advanced waste management system, which has evolved out of several regulatory changes because of waste problems from industrialization and population gr owth. 19 Total amounts of waste have decreased by 21 % from 2000 to 201 6 . 20 While incineration is the main waste treatment method in Japan, 21 the country’s recycling rate was at 20. 3 % in 201 6 . 22 Therefore, Susta i nalytics is of the opinion that SMFG /SMBC ’s green bond’s cont ribution in meeting the need to finance renewable energy , energy efficiency, clean transportation , green building , and pollution prevention and control projects in Japan, will result in positive environmental outcomes. Alignment with/con tribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable developmen t by the year 2030. This green bond advances the following SDG goals and targets: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Renewable Energy 7. Affordable and Clean Energy 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix Energy Efficienc y 7. Affordable and Clean Energy 7.3 By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency Green Buildings 9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure 9 . 4 By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource - use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities Clean Transportation 11. S ustainable Cities and Communities 11.2 By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerab le situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons Pollution Prevention and Control 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well - being for all at all ages 3.9 By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazar dous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination Conclusion The SMFG /SMBC ’s Green Bond Framework is transparent and provides clarity regarding the use of proceeds and the expected outcomes of the green bond investments. Renewable energy, Energy Efficiency, Green Buildings, Clean Transportation, and Pollution Prevention and Contro l are included in the GBP and Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2017 as E ligible G reen P roject categories that offer clear environmental benefits. Additionally, SMFG’s project selection process is based on external standards such as the Equator Principles. Thi s ensures that projects funded through bond proceeds have minimal or limited adverse environmental or social impacts. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the SMFG Green Bond aligns with the four pillars of the GBP 2018, and Japan’s Green Bond Guidelines 2017 . 19 Ministry of the Environment, History and Current State of Waste Management in Japan, February 2014 https://www.env.go.jp/en/recycle/smcs/attach/hcswm.pdf 20 Waste treatment of Japan 2016(Japanese), Ministry of Environment, Japan http://www.env.go.jp/recycle/waste_tech/ippan/h28/data/disposal.pdf 21 Waste treatment of Japan 2016(Japanese), Ministry of Environment, Japan http://www.env.go.jp/recycle/waste_tech/ippan/h28/dat a/di sposal.pdf 22 Waste treatment of Japan 2016(Japanese), Ministry of Environment, Japan http://www.env.go.jp/recycle/waste_tech/ippan/h28/dat a/disposal.pdf,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc.

CASBEE assesses two main factors: inside and outside the building site, which translate into Q (Built Environment Quality) and, respectively, L (Built Environment Load). Areas of Assessment: Environmental Performance of the Building • Energy and atmosphere • Sustainable Sites • Location and Transportation • Materials and resources • Water efficiency • Indoor environmental quality • Innovation in Design • Regional Priority • Energy • Land Use and Ecology • Pollution • Transport • Materials • Water • Waste • Health and Wellbeing Inno vation • Energy Efficiency • Resource efficiency • Local environment • Indoor environment Requirements Prerequisites (independent of level of certification) + Credits with associated points. These points are then added together to obtain Prerequisites depending on the levels of certification + Credits with associated points Score - based performance level CASBEE uses the BEE (Built Environment Efficiency) as its assessment indicator, 23 More information on the LEED certification scheme at: htt ps://new.usgbc.org/leed 24 More information on the BREEAM certification scheme at: https://www.breeam.com/ 25 CASBEE, BASBEE; http://www.ibec.or.jp/CASBEE/english/,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. Green Bond 12 the LEED level of certification There are several different rating systems within LEED. Each rating system is designed to apply to a specific sector (e.g. New Construction, Major Renovation, Core and Shell D evelopment, Schools - /Retail - /Healthcare New Construction and Major Renovations, Existing Buildings: Operation and Maintenance). This number of points is then weighte d by item 26 and gives a BREEAM level of certification, which is based on the overall score obtained (expressed as a percentage). Majority of BREEAM issues are flexible, meaning that the client can choose which to comply with to build their BREEAM performanc e score. BREAAM has two stages/ audit reports: a ‘BREEAM Design Stage’ and a ‘Post Construction Stage’, with different assessment criteria. which is calculated from Q (Built Environment Quality) as the numerator and L (Built Environment Load) as the denominator. Q and L are obtained through the classification and rearrangement of the four areas of assessment. Buildings may receive ranks rang ing from C (poor) to S (excellent), in order of increasing BEE value. For authorization, a building must receive a report from the CASBEE Certification system, which is afterwards assessed by the local government. Performance Display 27 Qualitative considerations Worldwide recognition and application Worldwide recognition and application In Japan, many local governments have made CASBEE assessment results mandatory for building permits compared to similar tools available. 26 BREEAM weighting: Management 12%, Health and wellbeing 15%, Energy 19%, Transport 8%, Water 6%, Materials 12.5%, Waste 7.5%, Land Use and ecology 10%, Pollution 10 % and Innovation 10%.

PROCESS FOR PROJECT EVALUATION AND SELECTION Overall comment on section (if applicable): SMFG’s Corporate Treasury Department and SMBC’s Planning Department, Treasury Unit worked together with SMFG’s Corporate Sustainability Department to establish the criteria for Eligible Green Projects, including Project Categories (a) to (e) above, in conjunction with the support provided by The Japan Research Institute (JRI), the think tank s ubsidiary of the group with extensive experience and knowledge in environmental fields . In cases where SMFG acts as the Issuer of a Green Bond, SMFG’s Corporate Treasury Department manages the process of lending the net proceeds to SMBC in a form of an in ter - group loan. SMBC’s Structured Finance Department selects the projects which meet the criteria. SMFG’s Corporate Treasury Department and SMBC’s Planning Department, Treasury Unit decide the eligible project for the green bond. Net proceeds of the green bond are to be allocated to selected eligible projects.

MANAGEMENT OF PROCEEDS Overall comment on section (if applicable) : SMBC Group has established and implemented systems designed to monitor and ensure the allocation of net proceeds from its Green Bonds will be transferred to SMBC via an inter - group loan and further allocated to Eligible Green Projects as defined above. R ecords will show an amount equal to the net proceeds from Green Bonds are allocated to assets that meet SMFG/SMBC’s criteria of Eligible Green Projects. Pending allocation to Eligible Green Projects, the net proceeds will be invested in overnight or other short - term financial instruments. Any of Green Bond proceeds allocated to projects that have been sold, prepaid, amortised or have otherwise become ineligible will be reallocated to other Eligible Green Projects. Also, payment of the principal and interes t on the Green Bonds will be made from SMBC Group’s general funds and will not be directly linked to the performance of any of the Eligible Green Projects. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that this is in line with market practice.

REPORTING Overall comment on section (if applicable): Allocation Reporting During the term of any relevant Green Bond, SMFG and SMBC will provide and keep readily available, on a dedicated website, information on the allocation of the net proceeds of the Green Bonds. This information will be updated at least annually until full allocation and as necessary thereafter in the event of new developments. This information shall include: i. the allocation of Green Bond proceeds to Eligible Green Projects, detailing the Eligible Green Projects funded, current funded amounts, initial funding dates and contractual maturity dates, and ii. assertions by management that the net proceeds of the Green Bond are invested either in qualifying Eligible Green Projects or in overnight or other short - term financial instruments. Impact Reporting In addition, SMFG/SMBC will annually publish on a dedicated webs ite information and assessments relating to the environmental impacts of financed Eligible Green Projects. SMFG/SMBC intend to report on the tons of CO2 emission equivalent, amount of energy saved (kwh), or amount of waste recycled (tons) depending o n project categories. The environmental impacts of financed Eligible Green Projects, where reported, may be calculated on a collective basis. These estimated environmental impacts will be calculated in conjunction with support from JRI. Sustainalytics is o f the opinion that receiving assertions by management as part of the allocation reporting is line with market . With respect to impact reporting, SMFG/SMBC are committed to reporting environmental impact indicators such as the tons of CO2 emission equ ivalent, amount of energy saved (kwh), or amount of waste recycled (tons), which is in line with market standard.

Consultant Review: An issuer can seek advice from consultants and/or institutions with recognized expertise in environmental sustainability or other aspects of the issuance of a Green Bond, such as the establishment/review of an issuer’s Green Bond framework. “ Second Party Opinion s” may fall into this category. ii. Verification: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework, or underl ying assets independently verified by qualified parties, such as auditors. In contrast to certification, verification may focus on alignment with internal standards or claims made by the issuer. Evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of und erlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against an external green assessment standard. An assessment st andard defines criteria, and alignment with such criteria is tested by qualified third parties / certifiers.,Framework Overview and Second - Party Opinion Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc.
