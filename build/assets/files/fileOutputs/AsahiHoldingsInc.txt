The business operated by the Company using the proceeds will contribute to solving environmental issues as it involves proper processing of and heat recovery from waste which is forced to be incinerated and disposed of in Japan amid a decline in the final disposal rate of waste in line with the formation of a sound material-cycle society due partly to increasing frequency and severity of weather disasters and issues of transboundary movement of waste. In terms of the environmental benefits, it contributes to reducing CO2 emissions through replacement of grid el ectricity through heat recovery and increase in efficiency of incinerators in addition to prevention of environment pollution caused by waste. R&I has determined that the use of proceeds is appropriate.  In selecting a project, comprehensive assessment is conducted in consideration of conformity to the environmental policy and contributio n to the priority SDG-related goals in addition to checking selection standards that give consideration to the environment related to technologies and facilities. The process has control and checking features, ensures expertise, and is clear and rational.  The Planning Division manages the st atus of allocation of the proceeds to individual projects using systems, etc. Appropriate response is stipulated, for example, evidence and other documents are stored as per the internal rules and unallocated proceeds are managed as cash or cash equivalent, short-term financial assets, and others.  The status of allocation of proceeds, environmental benefits, and other information will be reported annually on the Company’s website. The contents of report are reasonable as information such as the reduction of CO2 emissions will be disclosed by project.  The Company has a framework to build an environmental management system controlled by the ISO Secretariat and conduct environmental preservati on activities that ar e closely linked to its business. Examples of environmental activities include acquisition of ISO14001 certification for offices in Japan including affiliated companies, various initiatives to achieve the target to reduce CO2 emissions vs. FY2015 by FY 2030, and environmental preservation activities initiated by employees.

The Company conduc ted primary evaluation and selection of the project based on the following selection standards with a particular focus on environmental and economic evaluation. Technologies/equipment for which proceeds will be used Technology/equipment selection standards Power generation facility using heat generated from waste incineration Using waste as a heat source and ensuring continued stable operation and power generation Waste incinerator (building and upgrading) Efficiency of waste incineration (the fuel consumption per unit necessary for waste incineration) improves compared to the existing waste incinerator.  In addition to the above, comprehensive evaluation was carried out as part of the final selection in consideration of conformity to the environmental policy, contribution to the priority SDG-related goals, and probability of the occurrence of the environmental benefits. A final decision was made after holding deliberation at the Company’s group executive meeting. 3. Management of Proceeds  Group Finance will remit proceeds to the Company’s subsidiary Asahi Pretec while Asahi Pretec will allocate proceeds to each project. Unallocated proceeds are managed as cash or cash equivalent, short-term financial assets, and others.  The Company’s Planning Division is responsible for follow-up management of proceeds which is checked by the Accounting Division. Total amount of proceeds, proceeds allocated to each project, and unallocated proceeds will be managed using electronic files. Unt il all proceeds are allocated, efforts are made to match the total of the amount of unallocated proceeds and that of allocated proceeds with the total amount of proceeds. After all proceeds are allocated, efforts are made to keep the total amount of proceeds above the cumulative total of the amount allocated to each project. These checks are condu cted annually and evidence and other documents related to proceeds are managed appropriately as per the internal rules. 4. Reporting  The latest information on the status of allocation of proceeds to each project, environmental benefits and other information will be disclosed to the public on the Company’s website by project. Issuance report will be posted immediatel y after issuance of the green bond and annual report will be posted afterwards until maturity. When major changes occu r after all proceeds are allocated to projects, information will be disclosed as necessary.

Use of Proceeds For green bond proceeds to be used to invest in projects with environmental benefits, the eligible projects in which the funds are invested must be identified as being environmentally beneficial. Main basis of the evaluation  Details of the framework  The contents of the target project Evaluation  R&I has determined that the use of proceeds is appropriate based on the confirmation that (1) Sufficient environmental benefits are expected from the Project, and (2) Consideration is given to potential negative impact on the environment/society. [1] Are the environmental improvement effects from eligible projects sufficient? [Project 1] Upgrading of waste incinerator and buildi ng of new power gener ation facilities for Kitakyushu Plant, Asahi Pretec Reducing CO2 emissions through power generation wi th the effective use of waste heat to replace grid electricity. In addition, reinforcing exhaust gas treatment equipment attached to the waste incinerator will lower the upper limit of exhaust gas emissions compared to the previous equipment. Heat recovery of waste processing is promoted in the Basic Energy Plan and the basic policy based on the Waste Management Act. The Proj ect has been selected as a project for high-efficiency heat recovery from waste as par t of the 2018 subsidy fo r CO2 emission control projects, etc. (low-carbon waste treatment support project). Quantitativ e environmental benefits will be assessed by multiplying the volume of el ectricity generated by the grid electricity CO2 emission factor. [Project 2] Building of a new waste incinerator for Taniyama Rinkai Plant, Taiyo Chemical A large incinerator has been built for a waste pr ocessing facility that a ccepts infectious waste emitted from medical institutions, waste plastics emitted from various plants, waste oil, and other industrial waste. The new incinerator is highly efficient and reduces CO2 emissions as a result of reducing fuel for waste incineration compared to the previous incinerator. The fuel consumption per unit necessary for waste incineration in 2019 was more than halved from 2017, before the introduction of the incinerator. In addition, the waste processing c apacity will be increased which will lead to increasing the intake of waste pl astics and preventing dissipat ion of waste, etc., including the handling of disaster waste. Quantitative environmental benefits will be assessed by deducting new incinerator’s CO2 emissions from the existing incinerator’s CO2 emissions.,NEWS RELEASE 11 ■ Contact : Sales and Marketing Division, Customer Service Dept.

[Project 3] Upgrading of waste incinerator for Hibiki Plant, Asahi Pretec The introduction of a new incinerator will significa ntly increase efficiency of waste incineration compared to the previous incinerator. There is a plan to obtain permission for general waste treatment for the purpose of processing waste that is difficult to incinerate at local municipalities’ incineration facilities and handling disaster waste in addition to increasing the waste processing capacity. These will lead to preventing dissipation of waste, etc.  The Basic Act on Establishing a Sound Material-Cycle Society stipulates that in a sound material-cycle society, waste controls should be carried out in the order of [1] Prevention or reduction of generation, [2] Reuse, [3] Recycle, [4] Heat recovery, [5] Proper disposal; the final disposal rate of waste is on the decline. Meanwhile, waste processing in Japan has been a major issue due partly to increasing frequency and severity of weather disasters and issues of transboundary movement of waste. Further promotion of prevention or reduction of generation, reuse, and recycle of waste is deem ed to be an urgent issue. The Project that aims to reduce environmental burdens to the extent possible for waste which is forced to be incinerated and disposed of is of great significance. [2] Is consideration paid to potentially negative environmental or social effects?  As stated in the overview of the framework, environmental risks are identified and appropriate environmental preservation measures are taken.  In selecting a project, contribution to the priority SDG-related goals is being considered. Based on the above, R&I has determined that the project falls under “energy efficiency” and “pollution prevention and control” and the use of proceeds is appropriate as the use of funds for green bonds.

Detailed review Reviewers are encouraged to provide the information below to the extent possible and use the comment section to explain the scope of their review. 1. USE OF PROCEEDS Overall comment on section (if applicable) : ＜ Evaluation on the Green Bond Framework ＞ R&I has determined that the use of proceeds is appropriate based on the confirmation that (1) Sufficient environmental benefits are expected from the Project, and (2) Consideration is given to potential negative impact on the environment/society. [1] Are the environmental improvement effects from eligible projects sufficient? [Project 1] Upgrading of waste incinerator and buildi ng of new power generation facilities for Kitakyushu Plant, Asahi Pretec Reducing CO2 emissions through power generation with the effective use of waste heat to replace grid electricity. In addition, reinforcing exhaust gas treatment equipment attached to the waste incinerator will lower the upper limit of exhaust gas emissions compared to the previous equipment. Heat recovery of waste processing is promoted in the Basic Energy Plan and the basic policy based on the Waste Management Act. The Project has been selected as a project for high-efficiency heat recovery from waste as part of the 2018 subsidy for CO2 em ission control projects, etc. (low-carbon waste treatment support project). Quantit ative environmental ben efits will be assessed by multiplying the volume of electricity generated by the grid electricity CO2 emission factor. [Project 2] Building of a new waste incinerator for Taniyama Rinkai Plant, Taiyo Chemical A large incinerator has been built for a waste processi ng facility that accepts infectious waste emitted from medical institutions, waste plastics emitted from various plants, waste oil, and other industrial waste. The new incinerator is highly efficient and reduces CO2 emissions as a result of reducing fuel for waste incineration compared to the previous incinerator. The fuel consumption per unit necessary for waste incineration in 2019 was more than halved from 2017, before the introduction of the incinerator. In addition, the waste processing capacity will be increased which will lead to increasing the intake of waste plastics and preventing dissipation of waste, etc., including the handling of disaster waste. Quantitative environmental benefits will be assessed by deducting new incinerator’s CO2 emissions from the existing incinerator’s CO2 emissions. [Project 3] Upgrading of waste incinerator for Hibiki Plant, Asahi Pretec The introduction of a new incinerator will significantly increase efficiency of waste incineration compared to the previous incinerator. There is a plan to obtain permission for general waste treatment for the,3 ■ Contact : Sales and Marketing Division, Customer Service Dept.

These will lead to preventing dissipation of waste, etc. The Basic Act on Establishing a Sound Material-Cycle Society stipulates that in a sound material-cycle society, waste controls should be carried out in the order of [1] Prevention or reduction of generation, [2] Reuse, [3] Recycle, [4] Heat recovery, [5] Proper di sposal; the final disposal rate of waste is on the decline. Meanwhile, waste processing in Japan has been a major issue due partly to increasing frequency and severity of weather disasters and iss ues of transboundary movement of waste. Further promotion of prevention or reduction of generation, reuse, and recycl e of waste is deemed to be an urgent issue. The Project that ai ms to reduce environmental burdens to the extent possible for waste which is forced to be incinerated and disposed of is of great significance. [2] Is consideration paid to potentially negative environmental or social effects? As stated in the overview of the framework, environmental risks are identified and appropriate environmental preservation measures are taken. In selecting a project, contribution to the priority SDG-related goals is being considered. Based on the above, R&I has determined that the project falls under “energy efficiency” and “pollution prevention and control” and the use of proceeds is appropriate as the use of funds for green bonds. R&I has judged the use of proceeds under the framework is in conformity to Green Bond Principles 2018 and Green Bond Guidelines 2017 by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan. ＜ Evaluation on the Green Bond ＞ The eligible projects of the green bond and the e ligible projects under the framework are the same, thus in line with the green bond framework. R&I checked whether or not 1) sufficient environmental benefits are expected from the eligible projects in which funds are invested, and 2) due consideration is paid to potentially negative environmental and social impacts, similar to the eval uation of the framework. R&I eval uated that the us e of funds is appropriate as a use of green bond proceeds. For the reasons stated above, R&I has judged that the eligible project is evaluated to be reasonably beneficial to the environment. Use of proceeds categories as per GBP: ☐ Renewable energy ☒ Energy efficiency ☒ Pollution prevention and control ☐ Environmentally sustainable management of living natural resources and land use ☐ Terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity conservation ☐ Clean transportation ☐ Sustainable water and wastewater management ☐ Climate change adaptation ☐ Eco ‐ efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and ☐ Green buildings (Environmentally Responsible Building),4 ■ Contact : Sales and Marketing Division, Customer Service Dept.

Second Party Opinion : An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. 2. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. 3. Certification : An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification criteria. 4. Green Bond Scoring/Rating : An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 ‐ degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.
