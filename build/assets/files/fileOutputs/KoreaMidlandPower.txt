(“ KOMIPO ”, the “Issuer”) was founded in 2001 and is wholly owned by Korea Electric Power Co. ( “ KEPCO ”, or “the Group” ) . KOMIPO has approx imately 8 % of the total electricity generation capacity in Korea, as of the end of Sep tember 2018 , 1 and six generation facility sites in operation, including Boryeong Power Generation Site Division and Seoul Construction Site Division . 2 It also engages in the power plan t construction, operation, as well as maintenance activities. 3 The company is headquartered in Boryeong, South Korea. KOMIPO ’s parent company, Korea Electric Power Co . , is an integrated electric utility company in which the government of South Korea holds a controlling stake. Under the supervision of the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, the Group transmits and distributes substantially all South Korea's electricity. The Group prod uces a substantial power through its portfolio of nuclear, thermal, hydro, internal combustion, solar, wind, fuel cell, and biogas power plants that are located throughout the country. 4 KOMIPO has developed the Green Bond Framework (the “Framework”) under which it will issue g reen b ond ( s ) and the use the proceeds to refinance or finance, in whole or in part, existing or new e ligible p rojects that provide clear environmental benefits. The Framework defines eligibility crite ria in the following three areas: 1. Renewable Energy 2. Low Carbon Transport 3. Green Buildings KOMIPO engaged Sustainalytics to review the Green Bond Framework and provide a second - party opinion on the Framework’s environmental credentials, as well as the alignment of the F ramework with the Green Bond Principle s 2018 (the “ G B P 2018 ”), 5 as administered by the International Capital Market Association (th e “ICMA”) 6 . This Framework has been published in a separate document. 7 As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of KOMIPO ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and r ep orting aspects of KOMIPO ’s g reen b onds . Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of t he KOMIPO Green Bond Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. 1 KOM I PO Green Bond Framework 2 Korea Midland Power, Overview: https://www.komipo.co.kr/eng/content/186/main.do?mnCd=EN010101 3 Bloomberg, Korea Midland Power: https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=5482403 4 Bloomberg, Korea Electric Power Corporation: https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=380884 5 Sustainability Bonds are aligned with the four core components of both the Green Bond Principles and Social Bond Principles, wit h the former being especially relevant to underlying Green Projects and the latter to underlying Social Projects. 6 ICMA’s Green Bond Principl es 2018 https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ 7 KOMIPO Green Bond Framework: https://www.komipo.co.kr/eng/board/BRD_000092/boardMain.do?mnCd=EN030204&pageSize=10,Second - Party Opinion Korea Midland Power Green Bond 3 Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the KOMIPO Green Bond Framework Summary Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the KOMIPO Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the GBP 2018 . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of KOMIPO Green Bond Framework : • Use of Proceeds: - The three use of proceeds categories are recognized as impactful by the G BP 2018 . The eligible projects in these categories will provide meaningful environmental contributions in terms of improved access to renewable energy , low carbon transport , and green buildings . KOMIPO committed to only refinance existing eligible projects within 36 months prior to the date of the issuance of the Green Bond. - KOMIPO will promote the development of renewable energy projects in consideration of registering under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol , 8 including wind, solar and small - hydro power (<25 MW) . Sustainalytics views positively the CDM requirements and methodology , including the selection process , project cycle, approval and va lidation, which strengthen the potential environmental impacts of the registered renewable projects and steer international emissions reduction goals through carbon credits . - The solar projects will be stand - alone generation systems on the Boryeong Plant site. KOMIPO has confirmed to Sustainalytics that the development of solar projects will not be related to their existing or new coal generation process and the generated solar power will be sold directly to Korea Electric Power Co. - Sustainalytics n otes that the fuel cell systems may be powered by hydrogen derived from natural gas, however, it produces energy with near - zero GHG emissions. Furthermore, as renewable energy sources (solar, wind, and biomass from sustainable feedstock) are economically s caled, the potential for increasing use of these alternative resources exists for hydrogen production. Sustainalytics views positively this Use of Proceeds sub - category as hydrogen - based fuel cell technologies support the transition to a low - carbon energy, as well as encourages KOMIPO to consider the lifecycle impact of sourced fuels for fuel cell projects. - KOMIPO has confirmed that the electricity produced from the Incheon fuel cell power plant , that will be traded on Korea Power Exchanges or be supplied t o heating system s , will not be linked to fossil fuel generation facilities. Sustainalytics believes that this exclusion strengthens the Framework. - KOMIPO’s Wonju combined heat power plant utilizes biofuel power generated from solid recovered fuel 9 which expand s the recycling of waste resources and reduce s GHG emissions as an alternate to fossil fuels . Sustainalytics vi e w s positively the waste - to - energy conversion and recommend s further reduc tion of the combustion of fossil - fuel derived waste in order to mitigate the negative impact of resulting carbon emissions . - KOMIPO ’s green buildings eligibility criteria are based on third - party certification standards such as LEED Gold or above, BREEAM E xcellent or above , G - SEED Green 2 or above , or other equivalent national standards. Sustainalytics has conducted an evaluation of the certifications and views KOMIPO ’s focus on the highest levels of certification as industry best practice (refer to Appendi x 1 for additional information on the certification schemes). - The exclusionary criteria consider the following exclusions : nuclear energy, weapons, industries with high likeliness of child labor and violation of human rights, large - scale hydropower (>25 MW) , technology and equipment for large - scale hydro projects, transmission infrastructure and systems with 25% or more fossil - fuel generated electricity , and fossil fuel electricity production and energy efficiency improvement . Sustainalyti cs is of the opinion that these exclusions strengthen the Framework. 8 The CDM, as defined in article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, allows a country with an emission - reduct ion commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to implement an emission - reduction project in developing countries. These projects are then eligible to earn Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credit s, each of which is equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide. The se CER credits are then traded in carbon markets. 9 Korea Midland Power, Blog: http://blog.komipo.co.kr/485,Second - Party Opinion Korea Midland Power Green Bond 4 • Project Evaluation and Selection : - KOMIPO ’s project selection process involves initial project identification by the Green Bond Working Group (GBWG) consisting of various senior representatives , including the CEO, Engineering and Safety Division , Finance Team, Power Generation Department, as well as Climate Change & Environment Team . Sustainalytics considers that the collaboration between relevant business units is likely to stren gthen the implementation of the Framework and is in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - KOMIPO will track the net use of proceeds through a Green Bond Register . The proceeds of the transaction will be deposited in general funding accounts a nd earmarked for allocation to e ligible p rojects. - The unallocated proceeds will be held in accordance with KOMIPO ’s general liquidity management poli cy and can be invested in money market instruments , cash, cash equivalents, investment grade securities or other marketable securities and short - term instruments with satisfactory credit ratings and market liquidity. KOMIPO ’s process with respect to the management of proceeds is robust and in line with ma rket practice. • Reporting: - KOMIPO intends to publish a Green Bond Progress Report on its Investor Relations web site within one year of issuance, and on an annual basis , thereafter, providing allocation and impact reporting in line with market practice. - The allocation reporting will include relevant transaction data such as the aggregate amount allocated to e ligible p rojects , its proportion of total disbursements , and the breakdown of e ligible u se of p roceeds by geographical location as well as the eligible category . - The impact reporting may include environmental indicators such as renewable energy generation or capacity , annual GHG emissions avoided, annual renewable portfolio standards (RPS) purchased, energy saved, and n umber of electric and/or fuel cell vehicles and charging stations built . Alignment with the GBP 2018 Sustainalytics has determined that the KOMIPO ’s Green Bond Framework align s with the four core components of the GBP 2018 . For detailed inform ation please refer to Appendix 2 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Performance of the Issuer Contribution of the Green Bond Framework to K ore a Midland Power ’s sustainability strategy Sustainalytics is of the opinion that KOMIPO articulates a strong commitment t o a comprehensive approach to sustainability , including renewable energy development , energy efficiency and safety . KOMIPO has demonstrated business ethics a s well as a commitment to enhance energy security and mitigate climate change in its Sustainability Report 201 5 through the following efforts : 10 • KOMIPO ’s core mission is to provide a stable supply of electricity . I ts Sustainable Management Strategy states four goals (and 12 strategic initiatives), including a focus on technological innovation , the operations of eco - friendly power plants & safe workplace, the implementation of Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), as well as securing the carbon emission rights for the clean development mechanism (CDM). • KOMIPO ’s Vision 2025 Management Strategy System discusses the following: - The Strategic Goals and underlying Strategic KPIs which focus on (i) enhancing the facility operations efficiency, (ii) supporting the green energy projects, and (iii) promot ing the stakeholder value and social responsibilit y . - A ‘Vision G oal ’ of pursuing DNV’s International Safety Rating System - Culture (ISRS - C) 11 Index of 9.0, which is w ithin the highest level for achieving results in safety. • KOMIPO has set a goal of reducing the fine dusts emissions of approx imately 74% by 2025 below 2015 levels under its Fine Dust Reduction Policy, 12 and a mid - to long - term strategy to expand renewable 10 Korea Midland Power, Sustainability Report 2015: https://www.komipo.co.kr/eng/content/248/main.do?mnCd=EN040101 11 DNV - GL, International Safety Rating System: https://www.dnvgl.com/services/isrs - for - the - health - of - your - business - 2458 12 Korea Midland Power, Environment Protection Activities: https://www.komipo.co.kr/en g/content/250/main.do?mnCd=EN040201,Second - Party Opinion Korea Midland Power Green Bond 5 facilities and install CO 2 capture technology with a plan to reduce GHG emissions by 18% by 2020 below 2015 levels. • KOMIPO received the highest grade (‘AAA’) in the Korea Business Ethics Index Sustainability Management (KoBEX SM) hosted by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy . Additionally, KOMIPO won the President’s Prize at the 2014 Korea Green Management Awards, as well as ac hieved ‘Excellent Grade’ in the Anti - Corruption Policy Assessment of Public Organizations in Korea in 2016 for two consecutive years. 13 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that KOMIPO ’s sustainability strategy and action s demonstrate the importance it places on achieving positive environmental and social impacts. Sustainalytics also believes that KOMIPO ’s Framework is aligned with the it s overall sustainability efforts and can support Korea’ energy security and sustainable development initiatives. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the Use of P roceeds from KOMIPO ’s Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are r ecognized by the GBP 2018 to have positive environmental impact, Sustainalytics is aware that such projects could also lead to negative environmental and social outcomes. Some key environmental and social risks associated with the eligible projects include a lack of pollution control in construction and development projects, an increased exposure of local communities to adverse effects, and biodiversity loss. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that KOMIPO can mitigate such risk s through the following systems and processes: • KOMIPO ’s Strategic Goals includes ’s ophisticating the enterprise - wide risk management system ’ as well as ‘ safety management system ’ . In the past, KOMIPO has received recognitions for operating its Boryeong Thermal Unit for over 5,000 days with zero accidents or failures. • KOMIPO ’s Sustainability Management Committee under the Board of Directors consists of C - level executives , including the CEO, with subcommittees for expertise - oriented decision - making . Additionally, KOMIPO ’s Audit Committee and five Subcommittees under the Board of Directors ensure responsible management system. • In 2014, KOMIPO established the Code of Conduct for suppliers to provide strongly recommended ethical, social, and e nvironment al standards . KOMIPO also laid out its implementation plan for the UN Global Compact (UNGC) to continue complying with its ten principl es. • KOMIPO conducted a five - step IPS Materiality Test Model TM and selected nine core material issues in alignment with t he GRI G4 Guidelines. KOMIPO also created a Green Management Policy to promote innovation and eco - friendly management in power supply for the national development. • In 2015, KOMIPO established a Standard Manual on Conflict Management to understand, prevent, and manage conflicts with relevant stakeholders regarding the construction and operation of power plants. The Conflict Resolution Council was set up at each worksite with interna l and external stakeholders, including the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy’s public officials. • KOMIPO acquired ISO 14001 certification ( Environmental Management System) in 2004 and has since been conduct ing an annual environmental audit procedure . KOMIPO also holds the Ministry of Environment’s Green Enterprise Designation for its various power plants division as a result of actively striving to minimize environmental pollution with the participation of all employees . 12 Due to the stated management of environmental, social, ethical, and safety con siderations related to the development and operation of power plants, Sustainalytics believes that KOMIPO has sufficient measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the Use of Proceeds. 13 Korea Midland Power, Brochure 2016 : http://www.industrykorea.net/KOMIPO/KOMIPO_Brochure_2016.pdf,Second - Party Opinion Korea Midland Power Green Bond 6 Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds Environmental i mpacts The use of proceeds from KOMIPO’s green bonds will be used for financing or refinancing in the following three categories: 1. Renewable Energy 2. Low Carbon Transport 3. Green Buildings All three green categories are recognized as impactful by the GBP 2018 . Contribution of renewable energy to South Korea’s transition to a low - carbon economy R enewable energy account ed for approx imately 6. 7% of South Korea ’s energy generation m ix in 2017, and the country has set a national target to increase the share of renewable energy to 20% by 2030 with the growth mainly coming from solar and wind power , according to the government’s 8th Basic Plan for Long - term Electricity Supply and Demand . 14 The Green Energy Strategy Institute, a research wing of the Korean Society for New and Renewable Energy , 15 estimates that South Korea’s renewable energy share target is ambitious given the country’s limited total solar and wind power of 5.7 GW and 1.2 GW, respectively . 16 S ustainalytics considers KOMIPO ’s investment in renewable energy generation as instrumental to its contribution to South Korea’s renewable energy targets , and the related decarbonization targets under the Paris Climate Agreement which mandate that the count ry reduce its GHG emissions to 37% below business as usual emissions by 2030 . 17 Separately, South Korea’s Ministry of Environment calculated that the coal - based electricity production is the third most intensive source of fine particulate air pollution in South Korea, contributing to 23 premature deaths from outdoor air pollution per 100,000 people 18 . As a result, South Korea ’s government will seek to d ecrease the share of coal - based power generation and rebalance it with renewable energy sources through its next nationwide power demand - supply plan . 18 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that KOMIPO ’s renewable energy projects will positively contribute by reducing the company’s reliance on coal - fired electricity production, while having an indirect positive impact on the country’s air quality along wi th the complementing Fine Dust Reduction Policy set by KOMIPO for existing coal - fired facilities . Sustainalytics believes that KOMIPO is well - positioned to make an impact through its use of proceeds categories and that KOMIPO ’s Green Bonds will promote the adoption of climate change initiatives and support a shift towards a low - carbon economy . Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustaina ble development by the year 2030. KOMIPO ’s g reen b ond s advance the following SDG goals and targets: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Renewable Energy 7.

Sustainable Cities and Communities 11.2 By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons. 11.B By 2020, substantially increase the number of cities an d human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and resilience to disasters. Conclusion KOMIPO has developed its Green Bond Framework to fina nce, or refinance , a broad range of p rojects that will deliver positive environmental outcomes. KOMIPO has described a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for the allocation and impact reporting . Sustainalytics believes that the p rojects to be funded green bonds are aligned with KOMIPO’s overall sustainability strategy and will also contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, specifically 7, and 11. Additionally, Sustainalytics believes that KOMIPO has sufficient measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the e ligible p rojects funded by the use of proceeds . Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that KOMIPO is well - positioned to issue green bonds, and that the KOMIPO Green Bond Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the GBP 2018.,Second - Party Opinion Korea Midland Power Green Bond 8 Appendices Appendix 1: Comparison of Green Building Certification Schemes LEE D BREEAM G - SEED Background Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a US Certification System for residential and commercial buildings used worldwide. LEED was developed by the non - profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and covers the design, construction, maintenance and operation of buildings. BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) was first published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in 1990. Based in the UK. Used for new, refurbished and extension of existing buildings. G - SEED (Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design) is a green building certification used in Korea. First implemented in 2002, and later expanded in 2016, G - SEED is administered by the Korean Gove rnment under the authority of the Green Building Act (2006).

Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the align ment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer ’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or a ssociated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, wh ich may verify consistency with the certification criteria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as sp ecialised research providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate cha nge scenario.
