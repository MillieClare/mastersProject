INTRODUCTION innogy SE ( innogy ) is a European energy company, and the parent company of the innogy Group. The innogy Group is divided into three distinct divisions: (a) Renewables ; (b) Grid & Infrastructure; and (c) Retail . The R etail segment serves 23 million industrial customers and rese llers, as well as residential and commercial customers in 11 European countries. The company was created i n 2016 by carving - out the renewable, network and retail businesses of RWE (a German utility) into a separate entity. i nnogy is based in Essen, Germany. i nnogy has developed a Green Bond F ramework 1 in accordance with which it intends to issue green bonds . The net proceeds of the green bonds will be used to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, investments supporting t he transformation of the energy system . Proceeds of the bonds may be directed towards the following Eligible Green Categories : (i) Renewable energy projects; (ii) Energy efficiency projects; and (iii) C lean transportation projects. i nnogy has engaged S ustainalytics to provide a second opinion on its Green Bond F ramework and on the framework’s environmental credentials. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held convers ations with various members of innogy ’s treasury and management team s to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as aspects of the Green Bond F ramework related to the management of proceeds and impact reporting. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public docume nts and non - public information. Following this engagement, some elements of the Green Bond Framework were clarified to ensure alignment with the level of disclosure expected by the Green Bond Principles, 2017. 2 This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion on the i nnogy Green Bond Framework and should be read in conjunction with that framework. 1 Availabl e at: https://iam.innogy.com/en/about - innogy/investor - relations/bonds/green - bonds 2 “The Green Bond Principl es 2017”, dated 2 June 2017, issued by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA),© Sustainalytics 2017 3 2. SUSTAINALYTICS’ OPIN ION Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the i nnogy Green Bond Framework Overall, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that innogy ’s Green Bond Framework is robust and transparent. Sustainalytics views the following elements of the Framework positively: • Following an assessment of innogy ’s strategy, and of the projects that may be f inanced with proceeds from the green bond s (see Appendix 1) , Sustainalytics is confident that the issuance of green bond s aligns with innogy ’s mission and will advance the company’s corporate and sustainability strategy. For further details please see Sect ion 2. • The eligible categories for the use of proceeds are aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond Principles, and Sustainalytics considers that innogy provided a good level of disclosure for each category. Furthermore, in Sustainalytics’ view, the planned use of proceeds will have clear environmental benefits, supporting increased use of renewable energy and energy efficiency along innogy ’s value chain . Additional details on impact are provided in Section 3. • Overall, given the level of social and e nvironmental due diligence performed during the development stage of new renewable energy plants, and the regulatory framework of the countries in which innogy operates, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that innogy is well positioned to address environmental and social risks related to the projects financed by the green bonds. For further details please see risk a ssessment analysis in Section 2. • innogy ’s business divisions may propose pr o jects to be financed by the proceeds. Upon submission, a dedicated Green Bond Committee , with representatives from the business division, treasury and environment departments, will verify compliance of the projects with the eligibility criteria defined in the Framework and approve th e Eligible Green Projects. This is in line with recommended market practice. • On an annual basis and until full allocation of proceeds, innogy will publish a report disclosing the allocation of proceeds per E ligible Green Category or, where feasible , per Eligible Green Project. This information will be externally reviewed (limited assurance report ), which is in line with market best practice . Furthermore, the report will include information on the climate or environmental benefits of the projects (ann ual ex - ante estimates), in alignment with impact indicators defined in the Framework (e.g. installed renewable energy capacity, annual GHG emissions avoided, number of smart meters installed, etc. ) . innogy will also strive to deliver impact estimates in an investor presentation alongside with the issuance of each Green Bond , as well as information on to what extent proceeds will finance future projects . Sustainalytics considers that the efforts of innogy to disclose information on environmental impact are i n line with market best practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 2017 : Sustainalytics has determined that the i nnogy Green Bond Framework aligns to the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2017. For detailed information please refer to Appendix 2 : Green Bond Programme External Review Form.,© Sustainalytics 2017 4 Section 2: Assessment of innogy ’s mandate and strategy Contribution of the green bonds to inno gy ’s corporate and sustainability strategy i nnogy ’s goal is to “enable people to improve their quality of life by using energy more innovatively through sustainable products and services”. 3 In alignment with this ambition, innogy wants to be part of the companies creating a sustainable energy system by investing in renewable generation capacity, flexible energy distribution networks and innovative products. To support the energy transition movement, innogy is seizing the opportuni ties provided by important disrupting trends affecting the energy market, in particular: decarbonization, decen tralization and digitalization. The company has established three business divisions: - The Renewables division plans, builds and operates plants t o generate power from renewable sources, mainly wind parks across Europe; - The Grid & Infrastructure Division operates advanced electricity and gas distribution grids in Europe. These grids are considered important for the energy transition given the role o f infrastructure digitalization; - The Retail division supports customers with innovative products and services that allow them to improve their energy performance and to become a provider of renewable energy themselves. In close alignment with the corporat e strategy, innogy has implemented a sustainability strategy which sets expectations and includes progress indicators related to its economic, environmental and social performance. Environmental indicators include, for example, “ Sustainable electricity generation from renewables ” – 10 billion kWh in 2016; and “P rotection of natural resources by firmly establishing environmental protection in business workflows ” – in 2016, 100% of the employees were covered by the environmental management system, being 31 % externally certified. 4 Given the impact of its operations, especially the construction and operation of innogy ’s power plants, protection of biodiversity is also an important pillar of the company’s sustainability strategy. Along its value chain, innogy supports its customers (individual and corporate) saving energy and reducing their carbon footprint by offering energy consultation sessions by experts , who highlight the scope for potential energy improvements, and provide advice on climate - friendl y techn ologies and energy solutions (such as innogy ’s SmartHome intelligen t house management system, and solar packages supporting customers generating rene w able energy and home storage products). Finally, the company is an active member of several initia tives that support sustainable development, such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and the Netherlands Association for Renewable Energy. Given the assessment of innogy ’s mandate and strategy presented above , Sustainalytics is confident that the issuance of green bond s aligns with innogy ’s goal and will advance the company’s corporate and sustainability strategy. 3 innogy SE corporate presentation, August 2017 4 innogy Sustainability Report, 2016,© Sustainalytics 2017 5 Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects The most relevant e nvironmental and social risks associated with the projects included in the green bond portfolio stem from the potential negative effect of the construction and operation of wind parks , and hydropower energy generation on biodiversity and surrounding communities. To identify and mitigate such risks, innogy performs ‘Environmental and Social Impact Assessments’ in the phase o f project planning and approval of new plants in accordance with local regulations and international e nvironmental and s ocial s tan dards . T he assessment includes professional expert reports , and innogy engages with several stakeholder groups , including local populations , during the different stages of project development . i nnogy has shared with Sustainalytics an overview of the required licenses and impact studies performed for the Eligible Green Projects that will be (re)financed in its first green bond issuance (see Appendix 1). Examples include impact assessment on wildlife, s hipping and navigation and on tourism. Details of engagement with local populations are also disclosed in innogy’s Sustainability Report. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that, given the level of detail disclosed, and regulatory framework of the operating countries ( e.g. Germany, UK and The Netherlands ), innogy has performed a thorough impact assessment process through ou t project life - cycle, including both environmental and social considerations. innogy states that , d uring the operation phase, it constantly monitors project impacts and introduces countermeasures as necessary. To minimize the environmental impact, t he company introduces animal protection measures in its onshore and offshore wind farms, conducts surveys of bird populations, and in troduces impact mitigation measures such as switching of turbines on foggy days. In order to mitigate negative environmental impacts of its operations, all of Innogy ’s companies have implemented a n Environmental Management System (EMS) . 31% of its compan ies have an EMS that is externally certified according to ISO 14001, which is best practice. Furthermore, innogy provides a detailed list of environmental factors that need to be taken into consideration for acquisitions or participation in companies as part of its environmental due diligence framework. Overall, given the level of social and environmental due diligence performed and the regulatory framework of the countries in which innogy operates, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that innogy is well positioned to address environmental and social risks related with the proj ects financed by the green bonds. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds The proceeds of the bond will be used for projects in t he following three Green C ategories: (i) Renewable energy projects; (ii) Energy efficiency projects; and (iii) Clean transportation projects. Overall, Sustainalytics believes that the proceeds from the green bond s will have clear environmental benefits, supporting increased use of renewable energy and energy efficiency along innogy ’s value chain . Below, Sustainalytics provides an opinion on the imp act of innogy ’s green bond el igibility criteria, considering the local context and focusing on the analysis of some of the projects financed over th e past years by innogy .,© Sustainalytics 2017 6 Contributing to a sustainable energy transition and climate action Sustainalytics is of the opinion that t he use of the proceeds will contribute to the sustainable energy transition movement, as well as to Europe’s climate change 203 0 targets , including a 40 % cut in greenhouse gas emissions (from 1990 levels), achieving a 27 % of energy from renewables and a 27 % improvement in energy efficiency. 5 The proceeds will also contribute to climate ta rgets established by the countries in which the innogy operates. For example, Germany is aiming for a 61% CO 2 reduction (compared to 1990) for its energy sector by 2030 , and to generate 35% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 and 50% by 2030. 6 Within the EU, energy and transport account for 80% of greenhouse gas emissions. The refore, Sustainalytics considers that increased use of renewable energy , energy efficien cy and clean transportation will positively contribute to decarbonizing the EU’s energy supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. The importance of r enewable energy and energy efficiency projects i nnogy ’s green bond eligibility criteria includes the construction and installation of on shore an d offshore wind energy, solar energy, hydro power and other sources of renewable energy (e.g. geothe rmal, tidal, new technologies). Sustainalytics welcomes the clarification that the proceeds from the green bonds will only finance hydropower assets that comply with the Climate Bond Initiative T axonomy and are aligned with Climate Bond Initiative standards, when available. 7 According to the European Commission, renewable energy wi ll play a “leading role in any sustainable and cost - effective solution to climate change”. 8 As disclosed in the company’s 2016 Annual Report , innogy generated enough emissions - free electricity for approximately 3 million homes in Europe , and was involved i n the construction and operation of several renewable energy projects , including those to be financed by its first green bond . Furthermore , t he European Commission considers energy storage a s a key element to enable a low - carbon electricity system . 9 In addition to energy storage solutions, proceeds of the green bonds may also finance smart grid s and smart meters , which have the potential to offer energy more effi ciently to homes and buildings , and reduce energy consumption. 10 Smart grids enable the use of energy adjusted to local circumstances by providing energy where needed and thus reduces inefficiencies in the network. 5 European Commission, 2030 Climate & Energy F ramework, https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en 6 German Climate Action Plan 2050; http://www.bmub.bund.de/fileadmin/Daten_BMU/Download_PDF/Klimaschutz/klimaschutzplan_2050_kurzf_en_bf.pdf 7 The Hydropower Climate Bonds Initiative Standard is currently under development. CBI’s taxonomy defines eligible hydropower p rojects as (i) Run of river and small hydro (<15 MW), and (ii) Re - powering of existing large hydro system (to increase energy effi ciency and energy yield). 8 http://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/cop21 - brochure - web.pdf 9 European Commission, DG ENER Working Paper, The future role and challenges of Energy Storage, https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/energy_storage.pdf , published January 2013. 10 World Economic Forum, How technology and smart cities can help us overcome climate change, https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/12/how - technology - and - smart - cities - can - help - us - overcome - climate - change/ , published December 2015.,© Sustainalytics 2017 7 Moreover, the fact that almost 26% of Germany’s energy consumption comes from households , 11 indicates the potential impact of smart home solutions for the redu ction of energy use in Germany. Given the assessment above, Sustainalytics considers that financing renewable energy, energy efficiency projects will provide environmental and climate benefits that are highly relevant considering Europe’s energy policy context and the intention to transition to a low - carbon energy system . The importance of clean t ransportation projects Proceeds of the green bond may also finance projects that contribute to a reduction of emissions in the transpo rtation sector, such as charging infrast ructure for electric vehicles. The transportation sector accounts for 29% of all energy consumed in Germany 12 and is one of the major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. The use of clean transportation , such as electric or hybrid vehicles, is expected to contribute to the reduction of f uel carbon intensity reduction targets for 2020 . 13 As Germany is the largest European car market, there is a s ignificant potential impact of innogy ’s projects, given that the availabi lity of charging stations is an important factor for the uptake of clean transportation vehicles . 14 As of August 2017 , innogy had in total 5,8 00 charging stations operating in more than 20 countries and the compan y partnered with 15 0 municipal utility partners to form the Germany’s biggest public charging network. C ontributing to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable de velopment by the year 2030. The innogy ’s G reen B ond F ramework advances the following SDG goals and targets: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency 7. Affordable and Clean Energy • By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix , • By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency . Renewable Energy , Energy Efficiency, Clean Transportation 9.Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure By 2030, upgrade infrastructure a nd retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource - use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capa bilities . Renewable Energy , Energy Efficiency, Clean Transportation 13. Climate action While Sustainalytics recognizes that SDG13 is mostly suited to governmental institu t i on s, given close collaboration of utility companies with European governments to implement the defined Energy Policies, and specifically, innogy’s focus to support achieving renewable energy targets established, Sustainalytics considers that innogy indirectly contributes to SDG13. 11 http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/defaul t/files/medien/384/bilder/dateien/2_abb_entw - eev - sektoren_2017 - 02 - 17_0.pdf 12 http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/384/bilder/dateien/2_abb_entw - eev - sektoren_2017 - 02 - 17_0.pdf 13 Mitigation of Climate Change.

Proceeds of the bonds may be directed towards the following Eligible Green Categories : (i) Renewable energy projects; (ii) Energy efficiency projects; and (iii) C lean transportation projects. Given innogy ’s goal to “enable people to improve their quality of life by using energy more innovatively through sustainable products and services,” as well as the focus of the com pany’s business divisions, Sustainalytics considers that the issuance of green bonds strongly aligns with the company’s mandate and overall strategy. Furthermore, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the planned use of proceeds will have environmental ben efits along innogy ’s value chain, contribute to the EU 2030 Climate and Energy objectives , and advance S DGs 7, 9 and 13 . i nnogy ’s eligible projects are evaluated and approved by a dedicated Green Bond Committee with representatives from the business divisi on s , treasury and environment departments. This is in line with recommended market practice. The Committee also oversees the management and allocation of proceeds throughout the term of the bonds. T he company will publish an annual report disclosing the allocation of proceeds per eligible Green Category or, where feasible , per Eligible Green Project. This information will be externally verified , which is in line with market best practice. Furthermore, the report will include information on the climate or environmental benefits of the projects (annual ex - ante estimates), in alignment with impact indicators defined in the Framework (e.g. installed renewable energy capacity, annual GHG emissions avoided, number of smart meters installed, etc. ) . Sustainalytics considers that the efforts of innogy to disclose information on environmental impact are also in line with market best practice. Based on the above, Su stainalytics is confident that innogy is well positioned to issue g reen b ond s, and that the i nnogy Green Bond Framework is robust and transparent and in alignment with the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2017.,© Sustainalytics 2017 9 APPENDICES Appendix 1: Project portfolio – Examples of E ligible Green P rojects Eligible Project Project Name / Location Status of the project Percentage of ownership Impact On - shore wind park Zuidwester, The Netherlands In operation (at full capacity since 2017) 100% 90 MW of installed capacity; 80.000 households supplied.
