A. ( “ ABANCA ” , or the “ Bank ”) is a commercial bank which has its registered office in Betanzos, Spain. The Bank own s diversified financial service businesses including insurance, credit cards, payment management, and real estate servicing , and majorly operates three business lines : (i) Retai l Banking, (ii) Wholesale Banking, and (iii) Non - financial Sub sidiaries. As on 31 st March 202 1 , the Bank had over 6 , 0 00 employees, and reported around EUR 9 8 ,000 million in business volume . ABANCA has developed the ABANCA Sustainab le Development Goals (the “ F ramework ”) under which it intends to issue Susta inability Financ ing Instruments , including securitized products and thematic issuance s, such as B lue Bonds (collectively, the “Financing Instruments”) and use the proceeds to finance and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, existing and/ or future projects (or “Eligible Assets”) that are expected to create positive environmental impact . The F ramework defines eligibility criteria in one area: 1. Renewable Energy ABANCA engaged Sustainalytics to review the ABANCA Sustainab le Development Goals Framework , dated Ju ne 2021 , and provide a S econd - P arty O pinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 20 21 (GBP) . 1 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 2 Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ’ Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent 3 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which t he eligible project categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • T he Framework’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 20 21 , as administered by ICMA ; • The credibility and anticipated p ositive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and • The alignment of the issuer ’ s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.9 , which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations w ith various members of ABANCA ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. ABANCA representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of ABANCA to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and (3) that any provided material informatio n has been duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. Any upda te of the present Second - Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and ABANCA . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but doe s not measure the actual impact. The 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - prin ciples - gbp/ . 2 The ABANCA Sustainable Development Goals Framework is available on ABANCA Corporación Bancaria, S. A. ’s website at: https://www.aban cacorporacionbancaria.com/es/inversores/general/#programas - de - emision 3 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustainalytics and ensuring analyst independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable research. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust con flict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consi stency of process, structural separation of commercial and research (and engagement) teams, data protection and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ ha llmarks is integrity, another is transparency.,Second - Party Opinion ABANCA Sustainable Development Goals Framework 3 measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the potential allocation of p roceeds but does not guarantee the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be considered as being a statement, representation, warrant or a rgument , either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that ABANCA has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second - Party Opinion . Sustainalyti cs’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the ABANCA Sustainab le Development Goals Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the ABANCA Sustainab le Development Goals Framework is credible and impactful and aligns to the four core components of the GBP . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of ABANCA ’s G reen B ond F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - The eligible category , Renewable Energy , is aligned with those recognized by the GBP . - Under the Renewable Energy category, the Bank intends to finance renewable energy generation projects based on wind power and photovoltaic or concentrated solar power (“CSP”). Sustainalytics notes that the Framework limits financing to just those CSP proje cts that generate at least 85% electricity from solar energy resources and considers the criteria for renewable energy to be aligned with market practice. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - ABANCA’s Social Responsibility and Sustainability Committee , which consists of repre sentatives from the Bank’s Funding/Treasury team , and the Sustainability D epartment, along with the Bank’s Sustainability Workgroup, will be responsible for the evaluation and selection of Eligible Assets that will be pre - screened by its relevant business units , per the criteria defined in the Framework. - The Bank ’s business unit - level risk committees have the mandate to assess the risks associated with Eligible Assets. - Based on the clear delineation of responsibility , Sustainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - ABANCA’s Funding/Treasury team will be responsible for the allocation of proceeds to Eligible Assets . Eligible Assets will be labelled and tracked on an individual asset level through the Bank’s “ ESG qualifying system ” , with an aim to ensu re that the total value of Eligible Assets consistently exceeds the value of net proceeds raised from each Financing Instrument . - The Bank intends to achieve full allocation of proceeds raised from Financing Instruments within 36 months of each issuance . - Pending the allocation of proceeds , ABANCA intends to tempora rily invest the unallocated proceeds in cash or cash equivalent instruments , per its treasury management policy. - Based on t he management of the proceeds and the disclosure on the temporary use of unallocated proceeds , Sustainalytics conside rs this process to be in line with market practice. • Reporting: - ABANCA will report on the allocation of proceeds and , where feasible, the impact of financed Eligible Assets on its website, approximately one year from the date of the inaugural issuance and annually thereafter until full allocation. - The allocation reporting is expected to include the total size of each issuance, category - level details on the allocation of net proceeds, and the balance of unallocated proceeds. - The impact reporting is expected to provide category - level impact of Eligible Assets against respective key performance indicators , including (i) c apacity in stalled ( m egawatt (“MW”) ) , and,Second - Party Opinion ABANCA Sustainable Development Goals Framework 4 (ii) e xpected annual renewable energy generation ( MWhe per year) , and (iii) e stimated annual greenhouse gas (“ GHG ”) emissions avoided (t ons of CO 2 e per year ) . - Based on the Bank’s commitment to allocation reporting and, where feasible, impact reporting , Sustainalytics conside rs this process to be in line with market practice. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 20 21 Sustainalytics has determined that the ABANCA Sustainab le Development Goals Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 1 : Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of ABANCA Contribution of framework to ABANCA ’s sustainability str ategy Sustainalytics is of the opinion that ABANCA demonstrates a commitment to sustainability . This is evidenced by the following points of ABANCA’s strategy . These points are particularly aligned with the Framework: • ABANCA deploys a digital asset - tagging platform which helps its respective departments identify and label Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) - aligned assets. The platform also captures other relevant attributes, such as the size and capacity of the projects (if applicable), the region of financing, and allocation and repayment details. The Bank intends to leverage this platform to identify Eligible Assets, per the criteria defined in the Framework. • The Bank is a member of Net Zero Banking Alliance , a coalition of banks committed to aligning their loan and investment portfolios with the common goal of achieving zero emissions by 2050 . 4 During COP25 in 2019, ABANCA, along with other Spanish banks, presented a joint commitment to reduce the carbon footprint in its lending portfolios, in a way that can be measured with internationally approved criteria and in line with the objectives set in the Paris Agreement. 5 As on 31 st December 2020, the Bank’s total project financing with environmental interact ion amounted to EUR 700 million, which includes EUR 288 million worth of investments in wind power plants and EUR 343 million in solar plants. 6 In terms of the environmental targets for its internal operations, t he Bank intends to achieve carbon neutrali ty in its operations by 2024. 7 In 2020 , the bank surpassed its interim target of achieving a 50% redu ction in its Scope 2 emissions in the same year, and achiev ed up to 78% reduction (compared to 2019 levels). 8 In the same year , the Bank’s electricity consumption was met by 100 % renewable energy sources, which helped it avoid around 3.6 thousand tons of GHG emissions. 9 ABANCA has communicated that its headquarters in Madrid and Coruña have already achieved AENOR Zero - Waste certification s and its Abanca Seguros headquarters expects to obtain it by the end of 202 1. 10 In September 2020, the Bank launched “The Zero - Waste” at its corporate headquarters to drive waste - reduction efforts through inter - departmental collaboration. 11 Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Framework is aligned with ABANCA’s overall sustainability strategy and initiatives and will further the Bank ’s action on its key environmental priorities. Well - positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects While Sustainalytics recognizes that the use of proceeds from the Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are expected to have positive environmental impact, Sustainalyt ics is aware that such eligible 4 Abanca website, “Sustainability”, at: https://www.abancacorporacionbancaria.com/en/rsc/responsible - banking/ 5 Ibid. 6 ABANCA report, “Corporate and Social Responsibility Report” (p72), at: https://www.abancacorporacionbancaria.com/files/documents/memoria - corporati va - rs - 2020 - en.pdf 7 Ibid. 8 ABANCA has communicated the 50% interim Scope 2 reduction target to Sustainalytics. Furthermore, Sustainalytics notes that a proportion of the emission reduction may be attributed to the regional restrictions imposed in 2020, du e to the COVID - 19 pandemic.

Some key environmental and social risks associated with the Eligible Assets could include biodiversity concerns related to the construction of infrastru cture projects , occupational health and safety risks , and community - related issues . Sustainalytics is of the opinion that ABANCA is able to manage and/or mitigate potential risks through implementation of the following policies , processes , and regulations : • ABANCA has established the E nvironmental and C limate R isk M anagement P olicy as part of the credit risk policies manual. This policy has the goal of limiting and mitigating the impact of climate change and the potential negative impacts on the environment deriving from the Bank’s lending activit ies . In this regard, the Bank’s General Management of Corporate Control and Risk department has worked to identify those sectors or activities that produce significant CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere . The potential borrowers belonging to these sectors are required to carry out a climate risk assessment to ensure proper management of the risks associated with the financed projects . 12 , 13 • Sustainability is one of the key go als outlined within the Bank’s Code of Ethics and Conduct (the “Code”) that ensures that its compli a nce with all relevant laws and regulations. 14 Under the Spanish Environmental Law, all projects must comply with the Spanish environmental regulations that require public and private projects to under go environmental impact assessments and seek environmental permits. 15 In regard to habitat and biodiversity, Law 42/2007 (Natural Heritage and Biodiversity) in Spain sets out a regulatory regime for the conservat ion, sustainable use, improvement , and restoration of natural heritage and biodiversity. 16 • Regarding worker health and safety, the EU Directive on Worker Health and Safety ensures minimum safety and health requirements throughout Europe and requires the e mployers to "ensure the safety and health of workers in every aspect related to the work" . 17 Occupational risk prevention in Spain is based on the Prevention of Workplace Risks Law (Law 31 /95) . This law requires all companies to have a r isk prevention plan, a risk evaluation plan, and an emergency plan. In Spain, all employers are obliged to provide employees with information and training on health and safety issues. 18 , 19 • ABANCA is a signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible Investme nt 20 as well as the UNEP Finance Initiative’s Principles for Responsible Banking with an aim to mitigate environmental and social risks from its products and services. 21 Through Responsible Investment and Integration of Sustainability Risk Policy, the B ank address es sustainability and ESG - related risks associated with its investments . 22 • ABANCA’s Responsible Investment and Integration of Sustainability Risk Policy has a company - wide exclusion list which prohibits it from invest ing in certain organizations , including those that: (i) do not comply with sectoral or regional regulations, (ii) are involved in the produc tion arms of any type , such as nuclear, anti - personnel mines, cluster bombs or chemical and biological weapons, etc., ( iii) have association with alcohol, tobacco, or gambling products, and /or (iii) violate the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact (“UNGC”) . 22 • The Bank is also a signatory to the UNGC , committing to operate in a manner that protects human rights, eliminating unfair labor practices, and promoting environmental sustainability.

Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds The use of proceeds categor y is aligned with those recognized by the GBP 20 2 1 . Sustainalytics has provided some local context on projects planned under this Framework . Importance of Renewable Energy in achieving Spain and Portugal’s Climate Goals The energy sector accounted for more than 75% of the EU’s GHG emissions in 2018 . 24 Ac cording to t he International Renewable Energy Agency (IR ENA) , the use of renewable energy sources 25 can deliver at least 60 % of energy - related CO 2 emission reductions. 26 Accordingly, i ncreasing the share of renewable energy is expected to play a fundamental role in achieving the EU’s energy and climate objectives. Moreover, t he European Green Deal sets out the EU’s path to climate neutrality by 2050 . As part of this , in 2020, the Europe an Commission proposed to target a t least a 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 , compared to 1990 levels . 27 In order to achieve this target, the EU will need to fulfil at least 32% of its gross final energy consumption through renewable energy sources b y 2030 . 27 In 2019, renewable energy accounted for 19.7% of the EU’s gross final energy consumption. 28 Hence, the uptake of renewable energy sources across the EU will require significant investment s to support and finance new renewable power projects. In line with the EU ’s 2030 energy and climate targets, Spain established the Integrated N ational E nergy and C limate P lans (the “Plan”) , aiming for 2 3 % reduction in GHG emissions from 1990 levels , 42% energy end - use from renewables, and 7 4 % electricity from renewables by 2030. 29 To achieve the P lan’s objectives , Spain requires an additional installed renewable energy capacity of 59 GWs , by the end of 2030 . 29 I n 2020, the Spanish Government announced EUR 80 million of state funds for e lectricity production from renewable sources . 30 At the same time, Portugal has also established interim climate goals outlined in its Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan, aiming for increasing the renewable energy share to 47% in the gross final energy consumption by 2030. 31 In 20 20 , renewable energy accounted for around 3 1 % of Portugal’s gross final energy consumption. 28 In this context, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that ABANCA’s financing of renew able energy projects is expected to support both Portugal and Spain’s climate ambitions while contributing to the transition towards a low - carbon economy. 23 ABANCA, “ Commitment to Human Rights ”, at: https://www.abancacor poracionbancaria.com/files/documents/210304 - compromiso - derechos - humanos - abanca - en.pdf 24 European Commission, “ A Clean Planet for all ”, (2018), at: https://eu r - lex.europa.eu/legal - content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0773&from=EN 25 IRENA, “ Global energy transformation: A roadmap to 2050 (2019 edition) ”, at : https://www.irena.org/publications/2019/Apr/Global - energy - transformation - A - roadmap - to - 2050 - 2019Edition 26 IRENA , “ How to t ransform e nergy s ys tem a nd r educe c arbon e missions ”, (2019), at: https://www.irena.org/DigitalArticles/2019/Apr/How - To - Transform - Energy - System - And - Redu ce - Carbon - Emissions 27 European Commission, “2 030 climate & energy framework ”, at: https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en 28 Eurostat, “Data Browser - Share of energy from renewable sources “, at: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/NRG_IND _REN__custom_938915/bookmark/table?lang=en,en&bookmarkId=b365f4d1 - 44b0 - 4d52 - aee8 - a78770914695 29 European Commission, “Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021 - 2030 - Spain”, (2020), at: https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/es_final_necp_main_en.pdf 30 International Institute for Sustainable Development, “ Clean Recovery: Spain Offers Eur 181 Million For Renewable Energy Projects ”,(2020), a t: https://www.iisd.org/sustainable - recovery/news/clean - recovery - spain - offers - eur - 181 - million - for - renewable - energy - pro jects/ 31 European Commission, “Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021 - 2030 - Portugal”, (2018) at: https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/default/files/documents/ec_courtesy_translation_pt_necp.pdf,Second - Party Opinion ABANCA Sustainable Development Goals Framework 7 Alignment with/ contribution to SDGs The SDGs were set in September 2015 by the UN General Assembly and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. The bonds issued under the ABANCA Sustainab le Development Goals Framework advances the following SD Gs and targe ts : Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Renewable Energy 7. Affordable and Clean Energy 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. Conclusion ABANCA has developed the ABANCA Sustainab le Development Goals Framework under which it may issue Financing Instruments and use the proceeds to finance and/or refinance renewable energy projects. Sustainalytics considers that the projects funded by the proceeds raised from the Financing Instruments are expected to provide positive environmental impact . The Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impa ct of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the Framework is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use of proceeds category will contribute to the advancement of the UN SDG 7 . Additional ly, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that ABANCA has adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confi dent that ABANCA is well - positioned to issue Financing Instruments and that th e Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 20 21 .,Second - Party Opinion ABANCA Sustainable Development Goals Framework 8 Appendi x Append ix 1 : Green B ond / Green Bond Programme - External Review Form Section 1.

Second - Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second - Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second - Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of proje cts intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria.
