The Company offers air systems, building management , HVAC controls, security, and fire safety solution s to customers in more than 150 countries. Founded in 1885 and headquartered in Cork, Ireland, the Company has a global team of 105,000 employees. Johnson Controls has developed the Green Finance Framework (the “ F ramework ”) under which it intends to issue green finance instruments , and use the proceeds to finance and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, a portfolio of existing and/ or future Eligible Green P rojects across one or more of the following six categories : 1. Eco - efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes 2. Green Buildings 3. Pollution Prevention and Control 4. Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management 5. Clean Transportation 6. Renewable Energy Johnson Controls engaged Sustainalytics to review the Green F inance Framework , dated August 2020 , and provide a second - party opinion on the F ramework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) , 1 and the Green Loan Principles 2020 (GLP) . 2 This F ramework has been published in a separate document . 3 Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second - Party Opinion Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent 4 opinion on the alignment of the reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are credible and impactful. As part of the Second - Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following: • T he Framework’s al ignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA ; • The Framework’s alignment with t he Green Loan Principles 2020 , as administered by LMA , Asia Pacific Loan Market Association, Loan Syndications & Trading Association. ; • The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; • The alignment of the Johnson Control ’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . For the use of proceeds assessment, S ustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1. 5 , which is informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Johnson Contro ls ’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Johnson Controls representatives have confirmed (1) they underst and it is the sole responsibility of Johnson Controls to ensure that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has b een duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that Framework. 1 The Green Bond Principles are administered by the International Capital Market Association and are available at https://www.icmagroup.org/green - social - and - sustainability - bonds/green - bond - principles - gbp/ . 2 The Green Loan Principles are administered by the Loan Ma rket Association (“LMA”), the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association (“APLMA”) and the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (“LSTA”) and are available at: https://www.lma.eu.com/application/files/9115/4452/5458/741_LM_Green_Loan_Principles_Booklet_V8.pdf . 3 The Green Finance Framework is available on Johnson Controls International plc ’s website at: https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/corpora te - sustainability/green - finance 4 When operating multiple lines of business that serve a variety of client types, objective research is a cornerstone of Sustai nalytics and ensuring analyst independence is paramount to producing objective, actionable resear ch. Sustainalytics has therefore put in place a robust conflict management framework that specifically addresses the need for analyst independence, consistency of process, structural separation of com mercial and research (and engagement) teams, data protec tion and systems separation. Last but not the least, analyst compensation is not directly tied to specific commercial outcomes. One of Sustainalytics’ hallmarks is integrity, another is transparency.,Second - Party Opinion Johnson Controls Green Finance Framework 3 Any update of t he present Second - Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement conditions between Sustainalytics and Johnson Controls . Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second - Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible projects expected to receive allocations related to Gree n Financings (as defined in the Framework) but does not measure the actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner. In addition, the Second - Party Opinion opines on the intended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee the reali z ed allocation of the proceeds towards eligible activities. No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second - Party Opinion shall be conside red as being a statement, representation, warrant or argument either in favor or against, the truthfulness, reliability or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that Johnson Controls has made available to Sustainalyt ics for the purpose of this SPO. Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Green Finance Framework Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Green Finance Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the GBP and GLP . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Johnson Control s ’ G reen Finance F ramework : • Use of Proceeds: - Johnson Contro ls ’ six categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP and GLP. - For the “ Eco - efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes ” category, JCI intends on investing in product/ technology solutions as well as service support focused on optimizing water and energy efficiency of buildings . Re fer to Section 3 for further discussion of the impacts of these technologies. Below are d etails on products and solutions , as illustrated in the Framework 5 : ▪ Digital Solutions : Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things based solutions for improved environmental performance of buildings through smart data analytics and energy management software. ▪ Building Automation and Controls : Integration technologies to extend automated control to building systems , including smart HVAC and smart lighting , to drive energy performance and optimize resource consumption in buildings. ▪ Residential and Smart Home : Sensor - based controls and smart home thermostats as well as eco - certified air conditioning and heat pump units. ▪ Eco - Efficient HVAC equipment : Components and systems focused on improvement in energy efficiency to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in buildings. ▪ Distributed Energy Storage : Systems to support renewable energy generation, demand response, backup power, peak shaving, frequency regulation and load shifting to optimize energy usage in buildings. Examples of services and support include : ▪ Energy demand response installations, energy performance contracting, energy retrofit programs, intelligent lighting infrastructure, re newable energy installation and maintenance and water conservation solutions. ▪ Sustainalytics not es positively that JCI is considering equipment that contain s refrigerants with ultra - low G lobal W arming P otential (along with zero O zone D epletion 5 Please refer to the Framework for a set of examples un der this category published at: https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/corporate - sustainability/green - finance,Second - Party Opinion Johnson Controls Green Finance Framework 4 P otential ) . 6 Furthermore, in relation to refrigerant management, JCI adheres to section 608 of the EPA Clean Air Act , 7 or similar national requirements , while performing service, maintenance , repair and end - of - life replacement of commercial air condition ing and refrigeration and industrial refrigeration equipment. ▪ Sustainalytics also view s positively the inclusion of a 15% minimum improvement threshold for HVAC equipment . ▪ Overall, Sustainalytics views investments planned in this category to be aligned w ith market practice. - For the “ Green Buildings ” category, JCI will finance investments and expenditures fo r the design , construction , maintenance or refurbishment of buildings that have achieved , or are expected to achieve , a reputable green building third - party certification such as LEED ( “Gold” or “Platinum”), BREAAM (“Excellent” or “Outstanding”) or other equivalent local and regional certifications. Sustainalytics considers the referenced certification standards as being c redible and the selected levels as being aligned with market practice and having a positive impact (see Appendix 1 for additional details on the certification schemes) . - For the “ Pollution Prevention and Control ” category, the Framework allows for activities that will minimize or eliminate waste sent to landfill by JCI’ s manufacturing facilities. Sustainalytics notes the importance of the waste hierarchy in assessing the impact of waste management projects and highlights pos itively the focus of waste reduction. - For the “ Renewable Energy ” category, the Framework includes financing for the development, construction, maintenance , and operation of solar and wind energy projects . This category includes power purchase agreements (P PAs) , virtual PPAs and energy storage systems . ▪ PPAs financed will be long - term (at least seven years) and tied to specific projects which Sustainalytics considers to be aligned with market practice. • Project Evaluation and Selection: - Johnson Controls ’ Green Finance C ommittee , comprised of members from the Sustainability Leadership Committee (SLC), Treasury, Legal , and nominated subject matter experts, will be in charge of project evaluation and selection based on compliance with the Framework and JCI’s Enterprise Risk Management Program (ERM) . Additionally, Green Projects m u st comply with JCI’s ERM program which takes into consideration environmental and social risks. - Based on this governance structure with cross - divisional membership , Sustai nalytics conside rs this process to be in line with market practice. • Management of Proceeds: - The Finance Department of Johnson Controls will be responsible for management of proceeds and will allocate net proceeds from any Green Financing to an Eligible Green Project Portfolio . Eligible Green Projects will be added to the portfolio , which JCI will ai m to match or exceed the balance of net proceeds from its outstanding Green Finance I n struments . Pending allocation , JCI will hold or invest the unallocated balance of the proceeds in cash, cash equivalents and /or treasury securities. - Based on the establishment of a n Eligible Green Project Portfolio and the disclosure of temporary use of p roceeds , Su stainalytics considers this process to be in line with market practice. • Reporting: - Johnson Controls intends to prepare and make publicly available Green Finance report ing one year after each issuance, to be renewed annually and until full allocation on the Company’s website . The allocation reporting will be don e on a portfolio basis and will include total amount of proceeds allocated to eligible projects, the balance of unallocated proceeds and the amount or percentage of new financing and refinancing. The reporting will include qualitative and, where feasible, quantitative environmental metrics such as estimated annual GHG emissions avoided or reduced , tons of waste diverted from landfill, and estimated water savings. 6 Johnson Controls has listed as an example the YZ Magnetic Bearing Centrifugal Chiller which has a Low Global Warming Potentia l (GWP), zero Ozone Deplet ion Potential (ODP) and delivers up to 35% annual energy savings.

Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 and Green Loan Principles 2020 Sustainalytics has determined that the Green Finance Framework aligns to the four core components of the GBP and GLP . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 2 : Green Finance /Green Finance Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Performance of Johnson Controls Contribution of fram ework to Johnson Controls International plc ’s sustainability s trategy Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Johnson Controls demonstrates a strong commitment to sustainability , a s demonstrated in its 2025 Sustainability Strategy . The commitments made , to be achieved by 2025, are based on JCI’s footprint, sustainability materiality assessment, and its corporate strategic plan. The 2025 Sustainability Strategy centers around five key pillars each with its own target and goals . These five key pillars are : 8 • S olutions: Provide increasingly sustainable products and services – This pillar aims to integrate sustainable design for products and services identified to have the highest environmental and social impact. By the end of 2019 , the Company reported saving 29.4 million metric tons of C O 2 e and USD 6.3 billion through energy and operational savings . • Performance : Improve sustainability performance and track the Company’s progress – From a 2017 baseline, the JCI aims to achieve a 25% reduction in GHG inte nsity; a 25% reduction in energy intensity; a 10% water reduction at water - stressed location s ; a 25% reduction in recordable safety incidents; and increase diverse supplier spend at a rate exceeding revenue growth . By the end of 2019, the Company reported a 5.1% GHG intensity reduction and a 1.8% energy intensity reduction. • People: Foster a culture of sustainability that engages and attracts people who want to make a difference – This pillar a ims to volunteer 2.5 million hours and establish employee engagem ent groups globally, to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In 2019, JCI employees contributed total volunteer hours of 1.74 million . • Partnerships : Lead in global partnerships that significantly increase the Company’s sustainability i mpact – JCI is aiming to l everage its impact through at least three global strategic sustainability Partnerships . At the U.N. Climate Action Summit in 2019, JCI made a global commitment to the Three Percent Club for Energy Efficiency, The Cool Coalition and the EP100 Cooling Challenge which focus on building efficiency and high - efficiency cooling . • Governance: Demonstrate the Company’s commitment from the top – Through this pillar JCI is aiming to further integrate sustainability into the company’s goals and decision - making. In 2019 , JCI conducted a Sustainability Materiality Assessment that is aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ( SASB ) and the G lobal Reporting I niti ative . 9 The Company estimates that from 2002 to 2017, JCI has reduced its energy intensity by 47% and its GHG intensity by 41%. 10 In addition, Johnson Controls has committed to adopt science - based target s to limit the rise of global temperatures below 2ºC by the end of 2020 . Based on JCI’s demonstrated commitment and set of goals, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Green Finance Framework is ali gned with the C ompany’s overall sustainability strategy and initiatives , and that it will further the Company’s action s on its key environmental priorities. Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects Whil e Sustainalytics recognizes that the net proceeds from the Green Financings issued under the Framework will be directed towards eligible projects that are recognized by the Green Bond Principles ( 2018 ) and Green Loan Principles (2020) to have positive envi ronmental impact, Sustainalytics is aware that such eligible 8 Johnson Controls, “Johnson Controls sets new sustainability targets” , at: https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/insights/2018/enterprise/features/sustainability - goals - for - 2025#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls'%20new%202025%20Sustainability,high%2Dimpact%20products%20and%20services.&text=Increasing%20t he%20i m pact%20of%20our%20sustainability%20initiatives%20through%20global%20partnerships . 9 Johnson Controls, “Johnson Controls 2020 Sustainability Report”, 2020, at: https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/ - /media/jci/corporate - sustainability/reporting - and - policies/gri/2019/johnson_controls_2020 - sustainabili ty - report.pdf?la=en&hash=63C4727C436616C656A41E32DC0613A2421F3657 . 10 Johnson Controls, “Our Commitment to the Environment”, at: https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/corporate - sustainability/environment .,Second - Party Opinion Johnson Controls Green Finance Framework 6 projects could also lead to negative environmental and social outcomes . Some key environmental and social risks associated with the eligible projects could include occupational health and safety, managing community relations and ensuring stakeholder participation, and effluents and waste generated in construction or other proj ects executed by the C ompany . Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Johnson Controls is well - positioned to manage and/or mitigate potential risks through implementation of the following: • The Green Finance Committee , which is established for project evalua tion , will also ensure that all projects financed under the Framework comply with the Company’s ERM program which pr ovides a framework for management of key risks. JCI also has specialized committees and relies on inputs from management groups including th e Executive Leadership Team, Purchasing Leadership Team, Global Sustainability Council to oversee and advise on key sustainability risks . • The Company relies on its ‘Values First - The Johnson Code of Ethics’ which lays down the “Human Rights and Sustainabil ity Policy”. This policy defines specific principles and employee responsibilities regarding health and safety including minimization of worker exposure to safety hazards, maintaining appropriate emergency controls, and effectively track ing and manag ing an y safety incidents. 11 , 12 • The policy also states employee responsibilities related to environmental risks including minimizing adverse environmental impact from operations as well as implementing programs to conserve water and energy, and to reduce waste. 13 • Johnson Controls follows a Total Risk Management approach to identify and monitor risks across five pillars focused on different risks within the organization and communicate them to senior management. Within this approach, the Company has established an Enterprise Risk Committee which acts as a forum to discuss risks along with their potential impact and communicate key risks to the Board. 14 • Johnson Controls periodically conducts a materiality assessment to gather input about issues that a re most important to internal and external stakeholders . The feedback gathered is plotted on a materiality matrix to determine priorit ies and actions taken to address these issues are summarized and published on the Company website. 15 Based on these polici es, standards and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Johnson Controls has implemented adequate measures and is well positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible categories. Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds All six use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP. Sustainalytics has focused on two below where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context. Role of eco - efficient solutions in reducing carbon intensity of buildings Buildings are a significant consumer of electricity globally representing 20% of electricity consumption in 2018 16 and the largest consumer in the United States , accounting for 39 % of all consumption in 2 0 19 . 17 Residential and commercial buildings use electricity for a variety of reasons primarily including space heating , air conditioning , and ventilation . 18 , 19 11 Johnson Controls, “Values first” at: https://valuesfirst.johnsoncontrols.com/values - first/ 12 Johnson Controls, “Human Rights and Sustainability Policy” at: https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/ - /media/jci/suppliers/media - folder/corporate - responsibility/batteries/sustainability/conflict - minerals/human - rights - policy102017.pdf?la=en&hash=2AE227EA176EB6B9B2567D4EE93DF48B81D4412 4 13 Ibid 14 Johnson Controls, Introduction and Risk Management Narrative published at: https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/ - /media/8c834b7e35254e00b33832939765cf10.ash x 15 Johnson Controls, Sustainability Materiality Assessment published in 2020 at: https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/ - /medi a/jci/corporate - sustainability/reporting - and - policies/gri/2019/jci - sustainability - materiality - assessment - 2020.pdf?la=en&hash=C44BB2797CB27261F134AD5C3F92DEC953ACB479 16 US Energy Information Administration, International Energy Outlook 2019 published Septem ber 2019 at: https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/ieo2019.pdf 17 US Energy Information Administration, Use of energy explained at: https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use - of - energy/ 18 US Energy Information Administration, Use of energy explained: Energy use in homes at: https://www.eia.gov/energyexplaine d/use - of - energy/homes.php 19 US Energy Information Administration, Use of energy explained: Energy use in commercial buildings at: https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained /use - of - energy/commercial - buildings.php,Second - Party Opinion Johnson Controls Green Finance Framework 7 Advanced HVAC systems can help in studying and reducing energy consumption in unoccupied zones of the building, adapt ing to varying demand needs as well as detect ing need for maintenance. 20 These systems help in optimizing electricity consumption , thereby generating savings. Re search conducted by the Buildings Performance Institute Europe (BPIE) in 2017 found that building automation could reduce household electricity consumption by 27% and smart technology could reduce office electricity consumption by 23%. 21 They also contribu te to stabilization of the energy system through storage capacity and demand response activities and in turn enable a larger uptake of renewable energy . 22 Several states in the US have already set ambitious emissions targets for building decarbonization ov er the coming decades. In 2017, California passed legislation authorizing the California Public Utilities Commission to oversee US $200 million low - carbon heating programs and establish a building decarbonization framework. 23 In April 2019, the New York Ci ty Council passed legislation setting a target for buildings in the city to cut their emissions by 50% by 2050 . In this context, Sustainalytics finds JCI’s planned investments under the Framework to be relevant and expects them to deliver positive environmental impact. Importance of increasing the share of renewable energy According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), annual global energy demand rose by 0.9 % in 2019 . 24 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 25 issued a report in 2018 that outlined that as global energy demand rises due to population growth, 26 shifting towards clean energy plays an important role in mitigating climate change and meeting the Paris Agreement’s long term goal of limiting temperature increases to well below 2 °C, and ideally to 1.5°C . Although the share of renewable energy in global energy production increased by 3.7 % in 201 9 , 27 fossil fuel energy still meets 70% of the global energy demand. 28 The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) states tha t the total share of renewable energy must rise to approximately 66% of the total primary energy supply by 2050 in order to meet the 2 °C target. 29 While renewable energy generation in the United States has experienced significant growth, since 2008, it acc ounted for a total of only 1 7 % of the country’s total energy supply mix in 201 9 . 30 According to the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), by increasing renewable electricity generation from technologies that are presently avai lable, there is capacity for 80% of the country’s electricity to be generated from renewable energy, including through wind and solar generation, by 2050. 31 Sustainalytics believes that the use of proceeds from JCI ’s Green Financings will have a positive impact on the share of renewable energy generation in the United States, supporting a shift towards a low - carbon economy. Alignment with/ contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030. This use of proceeds highlighted in the Framework advances the following SDG goa l s and targets: Use of Proceeds Category SDG SDG target Eco - efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes 7.

Affordable and clean energy 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix Conclusion JCI has developed the Johnson Controls Green Finance Framework under which it may issue G reen F inanc ing s and use the proceeds to finance projects in six categories namely Eco - efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes, Green Buildings, Pollution Prevention and Control, Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management, Clean Transportation, and Renewable Energy . Sustainalytics considers that the projects funded by the proceeds will provide positive environmental impact. The Johnson Controls Green Finance Framework ou tlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the Framework is aligned with the overal l sustainability strategy of the C ompany and that the use of proceeds categories will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 6, 7, 9, and 11 . Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that JCI has adequate measures to id entify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds. Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Johnson Controls is well - positioned to issue G reen F inancing s and that the Johnson Controls Green Finance Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles (2018) and Green Loan Principles (2020) .,Second - Party Opinion Johnson Controls Green Finance Framework 9 Appendices Appendix 1: Overview of Green Building Certification Schemes LEED 32 BREEAM 33 Background Leadership in in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a US Certification System for residential and commercial buildings used worldwide. LEED was developed by non - profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and covers the design, construction, maintenance and operation of buildings. BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) was first published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in 1990. Based in the UK, BREEAM can be used for new, refurbish ed and extension of existing buildings. Certification levels • Certified • Silver • Gold • Platinum • Pass • Good • Very Good • Excellent • Outstanding Areas of assessment • Energy and atmosphere • Sustainable Sites • Location and Transportation • Materials and resources • Water efficiency • Indoor environmental quality • Innovation Design • Regional Priority • Energy • Land Use and Ecology • Pollution • Transport • Materials • Water • Waste • Health and Wellbeing • Innovation Requirements Prerequisites (independent of level of certification) + Credits with associated points. These points are then added together to obtain the LEED level of certification. There are several different rating systems within LEED. Each rating system is designed to apply to a specific sector (e.g. New Construction, Major Renovation, Core and Shell Development, Schools - /Retail - /Healthcare New Construction and Major Renovations, Existing Buildings: Operations and Maintenance). Prerequisites depending on the levels of certificati on, and credits with associated points . This number of points is then weighted by item and gives a BREEAM level of certification, which is based on the overall score obtained (expressed as a percentage). Majority of BREEAM issues are flexible, meaning that the client can choose which to comply with to build their BREEAM performance score. Qualitative Considerations Widely recognized internationally, and strong assurance of overall quality. Widely accepted within the industry. Sustainalytics considers BREEAM Very Good (provided a minimum score of 70% is achieved in the energy category), Excellent and Outstanding to b e representative of best practice.

Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implement ed within the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds. ii. Verifi cation: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, alloc ation of funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be termed verification. iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds cert ified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify consistency with the certification crit eria. iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research providers or rating agencies, accor ding to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as a 2 - degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from cre dit ratings, which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks. Disclaimer Copyright ©2020 Sustainalytics. All rights reserved.
