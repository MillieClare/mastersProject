(TRT) Green Bond 2 Introduction Tianjin Rail Transit Group Co., Ltd. (TRT), a company that provides transportation infrastructure and construction services, has developed a green bond framework (TRT Green Bond Framework) under which it plans to issue green bonds and use the proceeds to finance or refinance expenditures related to low - carbon transportation, pollution prevention, energy efficiency in systems, products, and technology associated with low - carbon transportation systems and renewable energy. TRT has engaged Sustainalytics to p rovide a second - party opinion on its framework and the framework’s environmental credentials. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of TRT’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their busin ess processes and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the TRT Green Bond Framework. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non - public information. This document contains Sustainalytics’ o pinion on the TRT Green Bond Framework and should be read in conjunct ion with the framework document . Sustainalytics’ Opinion Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the TRT Green Bond Framework Summary Overall, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the TRT Green Bond Framework is credible and transparent, and aligns with the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2017 ( GBP ) . Some key considerations of TRT Green Bond Framework include: • Low - carbon transportation, pollution prevention (particularly reductio n of air emissions), energy efficiency, and renewable energy are recognized by the GBP as eligible categories. • While Sustainalytics recognizes that prevention of noise pollution can be considered to have clearer links to health and social impacts, noise pollution is often classified as an environmental issue in China. Given the contextual relevance of noise pollution as an environmental issue in China, projects related to noise pollution have been included under TRT’s eli gibility criteria . • Sustainalytics encourages TRT to formalize its commitment to low - carbon transportation through policies and targets to reduce CO 2 emissions that are publicly disclosed. • The TRT Green Bond Framework has a transparent earmarking process for the management of proceeds whi ch includes a Green Bonds Register . • Sustainalytics is of the opinion that TRT’s impact reporting could be strengthened by reporting on the amount of CO 2 - equivalent avoided. This metric is considered to be market best practice. TRT has confirmed to Sustaina lytics that it will initiate an internal process to engage with external experts to look into CO 2 reporting, and Sustainalytics views this initiative positively. Alignment with Green Bond Principles 2017: Sustainalytics has determined that the TRT Green B ond Framework aligns with the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2017. For detailed information please refer to Appendix 1: Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of the Issuer Contribution of framework to issuer’s sustainability strategy In light of the current guidance from the State Council and the ‘13th Five - Year Plan’ for environmental protection and development of low - carbon economy, TRT has confirmed to Sustainalytics that it is commit ted to ensuring that its economic performance is beneficial to the environment and society. Sustainalytics encourages TRT to formalize this commitment through policies and targets that are publicly disclosed.,Second - Party Opinion Tianjin Rail Transit Group Co., Ltd. (TRT) Green Bond 3 Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with the projects Sustainalytics recognizes that the development of rail and transit infrastructure in emerging markets such as China is exposed to specific challenges. Rail and transit construction projects in China are criti cized for causing ecological destruction, introducing noise and dust pollution, water pollution from improper waste management, and worker safety incidents. After reviewing TRT’s internal documents and policies, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Tianj in Rail Transit has a robust internal environmental and social risk assessment process that mitigates these concerns. The robustness of this risk assessment process stems from Tianjin Rail Transit Group’s policies and systems that address the specific conc erns: • TRT conforms to various industrial quality control standards such as ISO9001 Quality Management, OHSAS18001 Health and Safety Management. • TRT has set up an environmental protection management system to address concerns surrounding the construction projects. This management system includes an emergency action plan. The system sets pollutants discharge ceilings for various pollutants, including carbon - dioxide and nitrogen. TRT has also included a list of the government regulations this project must co mply with, which cover issues such as air emissions, noise, vibration, water, waste, smoke, odo r pollutants. • Ecological Protection: TRT does not allow for temporary construction projects on permanent ecologically protected land. • Noise Pollution: TRT co nfirms that construction sites near environmentally sensitive areas will be enclosed, and sound barriers will be constructed around the construction areas. The construction teams will coordinate with affected local communities to set reasonable constructio n hours. When night construction is necessary, permission from local governments will be obtained in advance, and local communities will be notified of these schedules. • Dust Pollution Management: TRT’s environmental management documents state that dust po llution control performance measures are an important basis for contractor selection and evaluation. Other measures to manage dust pollution include enclosed construction areas with high walls, active water spraying, ground hardening treatments for materia l placement sites, site coverage and greening, centralized ground stacking and solidification. On - site mixing of concrete will also be prohibited to further reduce dust pollution. In addition, when an emergency weather response of level three or higher is announced for heavy pollution, construction work will be halted in response. • Water Pollution and Construction Waste Management: The dumping of construction waste and pollutants produced during construction into nearby rivers and waters is strictly prohibi ted. Construction wastewater and sewage will be pre - treated before transport or discharged into the municipal sewage pipe network. Wastewater from operations will be recycled to be used for washing needs. Scrap metal and other materials will be recycled wh ile hazardous waste will be handle by qualified contractors. • Worker Safety: TRT will leverage their ‘Safety Quality Department’ to oversee the construction project and to ensure that proper worker safety measures are in place and being upheld. TRT will also set up a dedicated construction safety management fund to help manage worker safety issues. In addition to the environmental management practices described above, TRT’s project selection process states a commitment to review environmental impact assessments for all proposed eligible projects, before a final dec ision is made to select these projects for funding through green bond proceeds. Based on Sustainalytics’ review of the environmental protection management systems, and the inclusion of environmental risk assessment in the project selection process, Sustai nalytics believes that TRT is prepared to manage environmental, social, and regulatory risks associated with the rail construction project.,Second - Party Opinion Tianjin Rail Transit Group Co., Ltd. (TRT) Green Bond 4 Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds Impact of low - carbon transportation in mitigating climate change in China While China is the world’s largest emitter of CO 2 , 1 the country is proactively taking steps to mitigate its contribution to climate change. In addition to its commitment to reduce the carbon intensity of GDB by 60% – 65% below 2005 levels by 2030 2 under the Paris Agreement, China published its 13th Five - Year Plan (covering 2016 - 2020), which sets out targets to develop a sustainable society and economy. The targets include challenges such as climate change, air pollution, water, urba nization, transportation and other issues on sustainability 3 and aim to contribute to the China’s commitments for the Paris Agreement. Specially, with respect to transportation, the plan promotes low - carbon, transportation services, adopting the applicatio n of modern transportation equipment and energy - efficient means of transport, 4 and encouraging market - based reform to railway sector. As such, low - carbon transportation is an important environmental issue for China, and plays an important role in contribu ting to China’s commitments to mitigate climate change. Importance of energy efficiency and pollution reduction in mitigating climate change in China The Tianjin railway is an important and highly utilized transportation infrastructure development that connects the capital city of Beijing and the large metropolis of Tianjin. The railway accommodates over 88 million riders a year . 5 China currently sources over 64% of all its power from coal, a figure that the country aims to reduce to 55% by 2020. Furthe r efforts to improve the share of low - carbon power in the country’s energy mix have seen this share increase from 17.9% to 19.5% in 2016. 6 These goals, in addition to numerous other targets, are included in the publication of China’s 13th Five - Year Plan. This plan sets out targets for the period 2016 - 2020 to make progress toward a sustainable society and economy, including objectives for environmental protection in addition to infrastructure targets. By 2020 this plan aims to reduce total estimated consum ption of primary energy to less than 5 billion tons of standard coal, reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 15%, to reduce CO 2 emissions per unit of GDP by between 40% and 45% 7 , to construct 3,000 km of new urban rail lines, and to expand the nation s high - speed rail network by 50% in order to cover 80% of all major metropolitan areas and cities. 8 These goals outlined in this plan provide major opportunities for transportation infrastructure development and energy - efficient green technological develop ment. Tianjin Rail Transit Group plans to address these goals through the design, manufacture, and installation of systems and technologies that reduce consumption and increase efficiency of their railways and transit networks. Tianjin plans to improve the ir energy efficiency and mitigate GHG emissions in their railway construction and operations. 9 1 Analysis: What global emissions in 2016 mean for climate change goals, Carbon Brief https://www.carbonbrief.org/what - global - co2 - emissions - 2016 - mean - climate - chan ge 2 China, Climate Action Tracker http://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china.html 3 The 13TH Five - Year Plan for Economic and Social Development of the People’s Republic of China ( 2016 – 2020), Central Compilation & Translation Press , http://en.ndrc.gov.cn/newsrelease/201612/P020161207645765233498.pdf 4 The 13TH Five - Year Plan for Economic and Social Development of the People’s Republic of China (2016 – 2020), Central Compilation & Translation Press http://en.ndrc.gov.cn/newsrelease/201612/P020161207645765233498.pdf 5 Ch ina’s High - Speed Program Back on Track http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/high - speed/chinas - high - speed - programme - back - on - track.html 6 China energy efficiency improved in 2016 http://www.climatechangenews.com/2017/01/30/china - energy - efficiency - improved - in - 2016 - reports - xinhua/ 7 China's 13th Five Year Plan: Environment http://www.kwm.com/en/us/knowledge/insights/china - 13th - 5 - year - plan - environment - sustainability - initiatives - 20160 41 8 China's 13th Five Year Plan: Infrastructure http://www.kwm.com/en/us/knowledge/insights/china - 13th - 5 - year - plan - infrastructure - projects - rail - airports - roads - 20160414 9 China's 13th Five Year Plan: Infrastructure http://www.kwm.com/en/us/knowledge/insights/china - 13th - 5 - year - plan - infrastructure - projects - rail - airports - roads - 20160414,Second - Party Opinion Tianjin Rail Transit Group Co., Ltd. (TRT) Green Bond 5 Alignment with/contribution to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving sustainable development by the year 2030.
